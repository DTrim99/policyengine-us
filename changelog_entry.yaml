- bump: patch
  changes:
    changed:
      - Use defined_for and p = parameters(...) more consistently.
      - Refactored TANF to sum only state-specific implementations, removing federal calculation.

      - TANF tests to correctly require eligibility for receiving benefits.
      - Lifeline benefit calculation by changing tuple assignment to addition.
      - Demographic TANF eligibility to use period.this_year for age calculation.
      - Demographic TANF eligibility to check is_in_secondary_school instead of is_full_time_student for student age limits.
    removed:
      - vehicles_owned variable as it was an unused imputation.
      - Federal TANF cash calculation variables and parameters except for core components (tanf, tanf_reported, tanf_person, is_demographic_tanf_eligible, is_tanf_enrolled, age limits, abolish_tanf) and TANF non-cash eligibility for SNAP BBCE.
    added:
      - Integration tests for TANF to verify state implementations work correctly.
      - Documentation in CLAUDE.md about period handling and state program refactoring.
