- bump: patch
  changes:
    changed:
      - Use defined_for and p = parameters(...) more consistently.

    fixed:
      - TANF tests to correctly require eligibility for receiving benefits.
      - Lifeline benefit calculation by changing tuple assignment to addition.
      - Demographic TANF eligibility to use period.this_year for age calculation.
    removed:
      - vehicles_owned variable as it was an unused imputation.

    added:
      - Illinois TANF implementation with il_tanf, il_tanf_eligible, and il_tanf_countable_income.
      - Integration tests for TANF to verify state implementations work correctly.
      - Documentation in CLAUDE.md about period handling and state program refactoring.
