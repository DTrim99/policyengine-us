Welcome to the Maryland 2024 Tax Year Booklet
Reflecting on the first two years of a four-year term, I am proud that our team has worked to 
modernize our agency and engage with Marylanders. We launched Maryland Tax Connect – a 
new and improved self-service portal for business tax filing and our agency’s first-ever report on 
the State of the Economy! This year’s rotation of covers highlights some of Maryland’s unique 
cultural institutions, showcasing our state’s museums that preserve its rich history and culture. 
While we couldn’t feature all the incredible museums to visit across Maryland, we proudly cel­
ebrate these three treasured institutions. Read below to learn more and send us your ideas on 
the attributes that make Maryland special that we should highlight in the coming years! 
The Washington County Museum of Fine Arts
Founded by Anna Brugh Singer and her husband William H. Singer, Jr. in Hagerstown, Maryland, 
the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts opened its doors in 1931 and expanded twice - in 
1949 and 1994. The firm Hyde & Shepherd designed the building in the neo-Georgian style and 
features red brick construction trimmed with local limestone. The American Association of Muse­
ums accredited the museum in 1997 and it is the only art museum in Western Maryland to hold 
this honor. The museum’s collection has grown to include over 6,000 art objects. 
The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum
The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum was founded in 1965 as a project of the Historical So­
ciety of Talbot County, which obtained three waterfront houses along St. Michael Harbor. The 
museum was once a site for seafood packing houses, docks, and work boats, and it currently 
houses a wide range of exhibits, artifacts, and vessels from the Chesapeake Bay. The museum 
has interactive displays that showcase the Bay’s history and physical and economic environ­
ments. It makes for a great visit for adults and children alike!
The Baltimore Museum of Industry
Founded in 1977, the Baltimore Museum of Industry (BMI) interprets the diverse and significant 
human stories behind labor and innovation in Baltimore, cultivating a sense of belonging and in­
spiring visitors to think critically about the intersection of work and society. Located in an 1860s 
oyster cannery on a five-acre waterfront campus, the BMI offers dynamic indoor and outdoor 
exhibitions, live demonstrations, tours, and hands-on activities for visitors of all ages. Current 
exhibitions explore the rise and fall of Bethlehem Steel at Sparrows Point, labor activism and 
unions in 21st century Baltimore, and the role of corner bars as social gathering spaces at the 
turn of the century.
The Francis Scott Key Bridge spanning Baltimore’s Patapsco River carried workers for nearly a 
half century—to steel mills, sugar refineries, and offices downtown. When it collapsed on March 
26, 2024, it was being repaired by middle-of-the-night laborers filling potholes so Marylanders 
would have a safer ride to their jobs. In response, the museum has launched an oral history 
project to preserve the stories of people whose livelihoods have been impacted by the bridge 
collapse. The stories and materials collected will form the basis of public programs and a future 
long-term exhibition at the BMI about the Port, its history, and the jobs it sustains.

A Message from the Comptroller
Dear Marylander,
Greetings! Thank you for taking the time to review our 2024 Maryland State Tax Forms and 
Instructions. We compile this publication each year to help guide Marylanders through the tax filing 
process and provide updates on tax code changes.
Our team at the Office of the Comptroller has been hard at work over the last year to begin an important revitalization  
in the agency. Guided by our agency-wide vision – to work in partnership to create a state that is more equitable, more 
resilient, and more prosperous so that every Marylander can reach their full potential – we set forth an ambitious agenda to 
modernize the agency and our infrastructure, obtain much-needed resources to better serve Marylanders throughout the 
state, and ensure Maryland is well-positioned for responsible long term economic growth and success.
The Comptroller’s Office released the agency’s inaugural State of the Economy Report in January, using economic data 
from 2023. My team led this collaborative effort to better understand the forces at play that have led the state to receive 
less revenue in the past year. Future reports will dive into specific areas uncovered by our findings. You can find all our 
research reports at marylandtaxes.gov/research to learn more.
As part of a much-needed modernization effort, we have launched Maryland Tax Connect, a self-service portal that now 
allows Maryland businesses to file their taxes online with increased ease and security, enabling taxpayers to interact with 
the Comptroller’s Office more efficiently. The portal is designed to allow taxpayers to complete essential functions and is 
accessible from a mobile device or a desktop. Our goal is for all Maryland taxpayers to be able to pay their state taxes and 
track their tax payments in this new system by 2026. For more information, visit marylandtaxes.gov/MDTaxConnect.
Additionally, during the 2025 tax season, eligible Marylanders will be able to file their state and federal taxes for free 
through the new Direct File program. Direct File is a new, simple, and secure tax filing software developed by the IRS in 
partnership with the Comptroller of Maryland, which will allow eligible taxpayers to prepare and file their tax returns online, 
directly with the government. Visit marylandtaxes.gov/directfile to learn more about this and other options available for 
Marylanders to file their taxes this year.
I am also pleased to report that we had another successful legislative session this past year. With broad stakeholder support, 
and in partnership with Governor Wes Moore, Senate President Bill Ferguson, and Speaker Adrienne Jones, we obtained 
additional resources for the Comptroller’s Office, including new positions to advance hiring efforts across the agency and 
$8.5 million for cybersecurity, training, audit efforts, equipment upgrades, maintenance, fraud, and accessibility-related 
projects, including translation services.
We also passed all six of our priority bills in our legislative package. Over the long term, these bills will help Marylanders 
by providing tax assistance funding for low-income residents of Maryland, supporting our agency’s compliance efforts, 
preventing and punishing tax preparer scams, promoting online filing, and providing resources to help raise awareness of 
personal income tax credits.
We look forward to working with you, your community, or your business. Only by building solid partnerships can we ensure 
the growth and thriving of our communities and businesses. Please call our team for assistance at 1-800-MD-TAXES or 
email us at taxhelp@marylandtaxes.gov.
Be well and please keep in touch!
My best,
Brooke E. Lierman

WHO MUST FILE?  
This booklet and forms are for residents and part-year residents 
of Maryland. In general, you must file a Maryland return if you 
are or were a resident of Maryland AND you are required to file 
a federal return. Information in this section will allow you to 
determine if you must file a return and pay taxes as a resident 
of Maryland. If you are not a resident but had Maryland tax 
withheld or had income from sources in Maryland, you must use 
Form 505 or 515, Nonresident Tax return. 
WHO IS A RESIDENT?
You are a resident of Maryland if:
a.	 Your permanent home is or was in Maryland (the law refers 
to this as your domicile). OR
b.	 Your permanent home is outside of Maryland,  but you 
maintained a place of abode (a place to live) in Maryland for 
more than six months of the tax year. If this applies to you 
and you were physically present in the state for 183 days or 
more, you must file a full-year resident return.
PART-YEAR RESIDENTS
If you began or ended residence in Maryland during the tax year, 
you must file a Maryland resident income tax return. See In­
struction 26.
MILITARY AND OTHERS WORKING OUTSIDE OF MARYLAND
Military and other individuals whose domicile is in Maryland, but 
who are stationed or work outside of Maryland, including over­
seas, retain their Maryland legal residence. Maryland residency 
is not lost because of duty assignments outside of the State; see 
Administrative Release 37. Military personnel and their spouses 
should see Instruction 29.
TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FILE A 
MARYLAND RETURN
a.	 Add up all of your federal gross income to determine your 
total federal income. Gross income is defined in the Internal 
Revenue Code and, in general, consists of all income regard­
less of source. It includes wages and other compensation 
for services, gross income derived from business, gains (not 
losses) derived from dealings in property, interest, rents, 
royalties, dividends, alimony, annuities, pensions, income 
from partnerships or fiduciaries, etc. If modifications or 
deductions reduce your gross income below the mini­
mum filing level, you are still required to file. IRS Pub­
lication 525 provides additional information on taxable and 
nontaxable income.
b.	 Do not include Social Security or railroad retirement ben­
efits in your total federal income.
c.	 Add to your total federal income any Maryland additions to 
MINIMUM FILING LEVELS TABLES
2024

income. Do not include any additions related to periods of 
nonresidence. See Instruction 12. This is your Maryland 
gross income.
d.	 If you are a dependent taxpayer, add to your total federal 
income any Maryland additions and subtract any Maryland 
subtractions. See Instructions 12 and 13. This is your 
Maryland gross income.
e.	 You must file a Maryland return if your Maryland gross in­
come equals or exceeds the income levels in the MINIMUM 
FILING LEVEL TABLE 1.
f.	 If you or your spouse is 65 or over, use the MINIMUM FIL­
ING LEVEL TABLE 2.
g.	 You must also file a Maryland return if you have Maryland 
income tax liability resulting from credits you claimed in a 
previous year that are subject to recapture. (See Instruc­
tion for Line 21a.)
IF YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE A MARYLAND RE­
TURN BUT HAD MARYLAND TAXES WITHHELD OR YOU 
QUALIFY TO CLAIM A REFUNDABLE CREDIT
To claim a refund for Maryland income taxes withheld or to claim 
a refundable credit (see Instruction 21), you must file a Mary­
land return. Taxpayers who are filing for refund only, should 
complete all of the information at the top of Form 502 and the 
following Lines:
	
1-16
	
22*, 29*
	
35-44 
	
46, 48
*Enter a zero unless: (i) you claim an earned income credit on 
your federal return, or (ii) you do not meet the minimum age 
requirement under the federal credit, but are otherwise eligible 
for the federal credit, for those without a qualifying child. 
Attach applicable withholding statements (Forms W-2 and 
1099), Form 502CR, and Maryland Schedule K-1 (510/511). The 
total amount withheld on all Forms W-2 and 1099 must equal the 
withholding you are claiming. Complete direct deposit informa­
tion (Instruction 22) if desired and sign the return.
2	
USE OF FEDERAL RETURN.  
First complete your 2024 federal income tax return.
You will need information from your federal return to complete 
your Maryland return. Complete your federal return before 
you continue. Maryland law requires that your income and de­
ductions be entered on your Maryland return exactly as they 
were reported on your federal return. If you use federal Form 
1040NR, visit marylandtaxes.gov for further information. All 
items reported on your Maryland return are subject to verifica­
tion, audit, and revision by the Maryland State Comptroller’s 
Office.
3	
MARYLAND HEALTHCARE COVERAGE.
The Maryland General Assembly enacted Chapter 423 in the 2019 
Session requiring the collection of certain information, including 
whether an individual is uninsured at the time the tax return is 
filed and whether the individual is interested in having Maryland 
Health Connection (“MHC”) determine whether an individual may 
be eligible for insurance affordability programs, such as no-cost 
or low-cost minimum essential health care coverage. 
Check the appropriate box on Form 502 for you and/or your 
spouse if you are uninsured as of the date you file your return. 
If you would like MHC to determine pre-eligibility for health in­
surance affordability programs for any uninsured member of 
your household, you must also check the box on Form 502 indi­
cating you authorize the Comptroller to share information from 
your tax return with MHC, which is operated by the Maryland 
Health Benefit Exchange.
For each dependent identified on Form 502B, check the appro­
priate box to indicate if that dependent is an uninsured indi­
vidual as of the date the return is filed.    
You must provide the date of birth for any uninsured individual 
who is interested in obtaining minimum essential health cover­
age.
If you authorize information sharing, we will share the following 
information with MHC:
•	 Name, SSN/ITIN, and date of birth of each individual identi­
fied on your return;
•	 Your current mailing address, email address, and phone 
number;
•	 Filing status reported on your return;
•	 Total number of individuals in your household included in 
your return; 
•	 Insured/uninsured status of each individual included in 
your return;
•	 Blindness status; 
•	 Relationship (self, spouse, or dependent) to the primary tax­
payer for each individual included in your return; and
•	 Your federal adjusted gross income amount from Line 1.
Information shared with MHC will be used to determine eligibil­
ity for insurance affordability programs or to assist with en­
rollment in health coverage.  If you would like more informa­
tion about the health insurance affordability programs or health 
care coverage enrollment, visit Maryland Health Connection at 
marylandhealthconnection.gov/easyenrollment/.

NAME AND ADDRESS.

Print using blue or black ink. 
Enter your name exactly as entered on your federal tax return. 
If you changed your name because of marriage, divorce, etc., be 
sure to report the change to the Social Security Administration 
before filing your return. This will prevent delays in the process­
ing of your return. 
Enter your current address using the spaces provided. On Cur­
rent Mailing Address Line 1, enter the street number and street 
name of your current address. If using a PO Box address, enter 
“PO Box” and the PO Box number on Current Mailing Address 
Line 1.  On Current Mailing Address Line 2, if applicable, enter 
the floor, suite or apartment number for your current mailing 
address.  If using a PO Box address, leave Current Mailing Ad­
dress Line 2 blank. Enter City or Town, State, and ZIP Code + 4.
If using a foreign address, complete the lines indicated 
for Country Name, Province/State/County, and Postal 
Code.
5	
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER(S) (SSN).
It is important that you enter each digit of your Social 
Security number in the space provided at the top of your 
tax return. Missing or unreadable digits will delay the 
processing of your return. Your name must match the 
name on your current Social Security card to ensure you 
receive your personal exemption. If your name does not 
match the name on your Social Security card, contact the 
federal Social Security Administration at 800-722-1213, 
or visit ssa.gov.
The Social Security number(s) must be a valid number issued 
by the Social Security Administration of the United States Gov­
ernment. If you, your spouse, or dependent(s) do not have a 
Social Security number and you are not eligible to get a SSN, 
you must apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification 
Number (ITIN) with the IRS and you should wait until 
you have received it before you file; and enter it wherever 
your Social Security number is requested on the return.


--- Page 11 ---

3
A missing or incorrect SSN or ITIN could result in the disallow­
ance of any credits or exemptions you may be entitled to and 
result in a balance due.
A valid SSN or ITIN is required for any claim or exemption for a 
dependent. If you have a dependent who was placed with you 
for legal adoption and you do not know their SSN, you must get 
an Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN) for the de­
pendent from the IRS. 
If your child was born and died in this tax year and you do not 
have a SSN for the child, complete just the name and relation­
ship of the dependent and enter code 322, on one of the code 
number lines located to the right of the telephone number area 
on page 4 of the form; attach a copy of the child’s death certifi­
cate to your return.

MARYLAND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION  
INFORMATION (REQUIRED).
Fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address of the taxing 
area as of December 31, 2024, including political subdivision lines, 
based on your residence on the last day of the taxable period. 
Part-year residents fill in the lines for your Maryland physical ad­
dress, including political subdivision lines, based on your last day 
of residence in Maryland in the taxable period. Military personnel 
who are legal residents of Maryland should fill in the lines for your 
Maryland physical address, including political subdivision lines, 
based on the Maryland physical address that is used for claiming 
Maryland as your Home of Record on file with the Defense Finance 
and Accounting Service for tax year 2024.
1.	
Find your 4-Digit Political Subdivision Code in the LIST 
OF INCORPORATED CITIES, TOWNS, AND TAXING AR­
EAS IN MARYLAND and enter this number on the 4 DIGIT 
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION CODE line.
               
When selecting the 4 Digit Political Subdivision Code, be 
sure that you have selected the proper political subdivi­
sion from the LIST OF INCORPORATED CITIES, TOWNS 
AND TAXING AREAS IN MARYLAND. Do not rely on your 
ZIP Code + 4 to identify the proper political subdivision.  
For example, most residents within the ZIP Code of Upper 
Marlboro do not reside in the political subdivision of the 
Town of Upper Marlboro. Therefore, entering the Town of 
Upper Marlboro on the 4 DIGIT POLITICAL SUBDIVISION 
CODE line for those with a ZIP Code in Upper Marlboro 
may not be correct. Also, some political subdivisions have 
similar names such as Bel Air in Allegany County and 
Town of Bel Air in Harford County or Town of Chevy Chase 
and Town of Chevy Chase View. You may contact your 
county seat for further information relating to the incor­
porated boundaries of incorporated cities, towns, and 
taxing areas in your county.

EXEMPTION AMOUNT CHART (10A)
The personal exemption is $3,200. This exemption is reduced once the taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000 ($150,000 
if filing Joint, Head of Household, or Qualifying Surviving Spouse with Dependent Child). This reduction applies to the additional dependency 
exemptions as well; however, it does not apply to the taxpayer’s age or blindness exemption of $1,000. Use the chart to determine the 
allowable exemption amount based upon the filing status. NOTE: For certain taxpayers with interest from U.S. obligations see Instruction 13, 
Line 13, code hh for applicable exemption adjustment.

If you itemized your deductions on the joint federal return, one 
spouse may use the standard deduction and the other spouse 
may claim those deductions on the federal return that are “at­
tributable exclusively” to that spouse, plus a prorated amount 
of the remaining deductions. If it is not possible to determine 
these deductions, the deduction must be allocated proportion­
ately based on your share of the income.
“Attributable exclusively” means that the individual is solely 
responsible for the payment of an expense claimed as an item­
ized deduction, including compliance with a valid court order or 
separation agreement; or the individual jointly responsible for 
the payment of an expense claimed as an itemized deduction 
can demonstrate payment of the full amount of the deduction 
with funds that are not attributable in whole or in part, to the 
other jointly responsible individual.
If both spouses choose to itemize on their separate Maryland 
returns, then each spouse must determine which deductions 
are attributable exclusively to each spouse and prorate the 
remaining deductions using the Maryland Income Factor. See 
Instruction 26k. If it is not possible to determine deductions 
in this manner, they must be allocated proportionately based 
on their respective shares of the income. The total amount of 
itemized deductions for both spouses cannot exceed the item­
ized deductions on the federal return. 
If you choose to use the standard deduction method, use  STAN­
DARD DEDUCTION WORKSHEET (16A) in Instruction 16. Each 
spouse must claim their own personal exemption. Each spouse may 
allocate the dependent exemptions in any manner they choose. A 
dependent may not be claimed twice. The total number of depen­
dents claimed may not exceed the overall number of dependents.
Complete the remainder of the form using the instructions for 
each line. Each spouse should claim their own withholding and 
other credits. Joint estimated tax paid may be divided between 
the spouses in any manner provided the total claimed does not 
exceed the total estimated tax paid.

EXEMPTIONS ALLOWED
You are entitled to claim qualified exemptions on your Maryland 
return. The amount of your Maryland exemption may be limited

emption Amount Chart (10A).
You and your spouse are permitted to claim additional exemptions 
if, on the last day of the taxable year, you or your spouse is age 65 
or older or blind. These additional exemptions are in the amount of 
$1,000 each. An individual who turns 65 or becomes blind after the 
last day of the taxable year, but before they file their return, does 
not qualify for the additional exemption. If any other dependent 
claimed is 65 or over, you also receive an additional exemption of 
up to $3,200. Make sure you check both boxes (4) and (5) of Form 
502B for each of your dependents who are age 65 or over. You must 
provide the date(s) of birth for all individuals listed on the 502B.

clusion and enter the total amount on Line 10a, Form 502. On 
Line 10a, Form 502 check the applicable box(es) for yourself

To be considered totally disabled, you must have a mental or 
physical impairment which prevents you from engaging in sub­
stantial gainful activity. You must expect the impairment to be 
of long, continued, or indefinite duration or to result in your 
death. You must attach to your return a certification from a 
qualified physician stating the nature of your impairment and 
that you are totally disabled. If you have previously submitted 
a physician’s certification, attach your own statement that you 
are still totally disabled and that a physician’s certification was 
submitted before.
If you are a part-year resident, complete  PENSION EXCLUSION 
COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A) using total taxable pension 
and total Social Security and railroad retirement benefits as if 
you were a full-year resident. Prorate the amount on Line 5 by 
the number of months of Maryland residence divided by 12.
However, if you began to receive your pension during the tax 
year you became a Maryland resident, use a proration factor of 
the number of months you were a resident divided by the num­
ber of months the pension was received.
For example, Pat Taxpayer moved to Maryland on March 1. If 
he started to receive his pension on March 1, he would prorate 
the pension exclusion by 10/10, which would mean he would be 
entitled to the full pension exclusion. However, if he began to 
receive his pension on February 1, Pat would prorate his pen­
sion by 10/11. Note that, in any case, the proration factor may 
not exceed 1.
Complete the PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORK­
SHEET (13A). Copy the amount from Line 5 of the worksheet 
onto Line 10a, Form 502. On Line 10a, Form 502 check the ap­
plicable box(es) for yourself and/or spouse.
Note: You must complete and attach Form 502R to Form 502 if 
you or your spouse are claiming a pension exclusion on Line 10a 
of Form 502.  See Form 502R for additional information.

Line 10b. PENSION EXCLUSION FOR RETIRED FOREST/
PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER. An individual taxpayer may not 
claim BOTH the standard Pension Exclusion and the Pension Ex­
clusion for Retired Forest/Park/Wildlife Ranger. If you are 65 or 
older on the last day of the calendar year, you are totally dis­
abled, or your spouse is totally disabled, and you have received 
qualified pension income, you should complete the PENSION 
EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A) regardless of 
your prior work history. It is permissible for one spouse to claim 
the standard Pension Exclusion and the other spouse to claim 
the Pension Exclusion for Retired Forest/Park/Wildlife Ranger, if 
each spouse meets the applicable required criteria. 
If you meet the following criteria, use the RETIRED FOREST/
PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTA­
TION WORKSHEET (13E) to calculate your eligible pension ex­
clusion:
a.	 You were 55 or over on the last day of the tax year, 
AND
b.	 You were not 65 or older, or totally disabled, or have a 
spouse who is totally disabled, AND
c.	 You included on your federal return taxable income 
received as a pension, annuity, or endowment from an 
“employee retirement system” qualified under Section 
401(a), 403 or 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (a 
traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, a rollover IRA, a simpli­
fied employee plan (SEP), a Keogh plan, an ineligible 
deferred compensation plan for foreign retirement in­
come does not qualify.), AND
d.	 The retirement income is attributable to your service 
as a Forest/Park/Wildlife Ranger of the United States, 
the State of Maryland or a political subdivision of 
Maryland.
	
Each spouse who meets the above requirements may be 
entitled to the exclusion. If each spouse is eligible, com­
plete a separate column on the RETIRED FOREST/PARK/
WILDLIFE RANGER PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION 
WORKSHEET (13E). Combine your allowable exclusions 
from Line 8 of the worksheet and enter the total amount 
on Line 10b, Form 502. On Line 10b, Form 502 check the 
applicable box(es) for yourself and/or spouse.
	
If you are a part-year resident, complete the RETIRED 
FOREST/PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER PENSION EXCLUSION 
COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13E) using total taxable pen­
sion and total Social Security and railroad retirement ben­
efits as if you were a full-year resident. Prorate the amount 
on Line  8 by the number of months of Maryland residence 
divided by 12. However, if you began to receive your pen­
sion during the tax year you became a Maryland resident, 
use a proration factor of the number of months you were 
a resident divided by the number of months the pension 
was received. Copy the prorated amount from Line 8 of the 
worksheet onto Line 10b, Form 502.
	
For example, Pat Taxpayer moved to Maryland on March 1. 
If he started to receive his pension on March 1, he would 
prorate the pension exclusion by 10/10, which would mean 
he would be entitled to the full pension exclusion. However, 
if he began to receive his pension on February 1, Pat would 
prorate his pension by 10/11. In any case, the prorated fac­
tor may not exceed 1.
	
Note: You must complete and attach Form 502R to the 
Form 502 if you and/or your spouse are claiming a pension 
exclusion on Line 10b of Form 502. See the Form 502R for 
additional information. 
Line 11. FEDERALLY TAXED SOCIAL SECURITY AND RAIL­
ROAD RETIREMENT BENEFITS. If you included in your fed­
eral adjusted gross income Social Security, Tier I, Tier II and/
or supplemental railroad retirement benefits, then you must in­
clude the total amount of such benefits on Line 11. Social Secu­
rity and railroad retirement benefits are exempt from state tax.
Note: You must complete and attach Form 502R to the Form 
502 if you or your spouse received any income during the tax 
year (taxable or nontaxable) from Social Security or Railroad 
Retirement (Tier I or Tier II). See Form 502R for additional in­
formation.
Line 12. NONRESIDENT INCOME. If you began or ended your 
residence in Maryland during the year, you may subtract the 
portion of your income received when you were not a resident 
of Maryland. See Instruction 26 for part-year residents and 
Technical Bulletin 1 for military personnel.
If your state of residence or your period of Maryland residence 
was not the same as that of your spouse and you filed a joint 
return, follow Instruction 26 (c) through (p).

total income).
ff.	
Amount of the cost difference between a conventional on-
site sewage disposal and a system that uses nitrogen re­
moval technology, for which the Department of Environ­
ment’s payment assistance program does not cover. An 
individual must have applied to the Department of the En­
vironment for assistance to claim the subtraction modifica­
tion on the Form 502SU. Also, in order to claim the sub­
traction modification, the system that is purchased must be 
a system that utilizes nitrogen removal technology as per 
Environment Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland § 
9-1108.
hh.	 Exemption adjustment for certain taxpayers with inter­
est on U.S. obligations. If you have received income from 
U.S. obligations and your federal adjusted gross income 
exceeds $100,000 ($150,000 if filing joint, head of house­
hold, or qualifying surviving spouse, enter the difference, if 
any, between the exemption amount based on your federal 
adjusted gross income and the exemption amount based 
upon your federal adjusted gross income after subtracting 
your U.S. obligations using the EXEMPTION ADJUSTMENT 
WORKSHEET (13C).
If the amount is greater than zero (0), enter this amount as a 
subtraction on Line hh of Form 502SU.
Example:
Pat and Chris Jones had a federal adjusted gross income of 
$180,000. They also had $40,000 on interest from U.S. Sav­
ings Bonds and had a dependent son whom they claimed on the 
Maryland tax return. Using Instruction 10, they found the exemp­
tion amount on their Maryland return (based upon $180,000 of 
income) was $2,400 ($800 for three exemptions). If it were not 
for the $40,000 of U.S. Savings Bonds, their federal adjusted 
gross income would have been $140,000 and their exemption 
amount would have been $9,600 ($3,200 for three exemptions). 
Therefore, Pat and Chris Jones are entitled to claim a subtraction 
of $7,200 ($9,600 - $2,400) on Line hh of Form 502SU.
ii.		
Interest on any Build America Bond that is included in your 
federal adjusted gross income. See Administrative Release 13.

mm.	 Amount received by a claimant for noneconomic damages as 
a result of a claim of unlawful discrimination under Internal

nn.	
Amount of student loan indebtedness discharged. Attach a copy 
of the notice stating that the loans have been discharged.
oo.	
Up to $5,000 of income earned by an eligible law enforce­
ment officer. A law enforcement officer means a person

	 ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS.
 
If you figure your tax by the ITEMIZED DEDUCTION 
METHOD, complete Lines 17a and b on Form 502. (See In­
struction 16 to see if you will use the ITEMIZED DEDUC­
TION METHOD.)
Copy the amount from federal Form 1040, Schedule A, Line 17, 
Total Itemized Deductions, on Line 17a of Form 502. Certain 
items of federal itemized deductions are not eligible for State 
purposes and must be subtracted from Line 17a. State and local 
income taxes used as a deduction for federal purposes must be 
entered on Line 17b (there are certain limitations on the deduc­
tion amount of state and local tax. For more information, visit 
marylandtaxes.gov). Also, any amounts deducted as contri­
butions of Preservation or Conservation Easements for which a 
credit is claimed must be added to Line 17b.
You are not required to itemize deductions on your Maryland 
return because you have itemized deductions on your federal 
return. Figure your tax each way to determine which method is 
best for you.
If your unreimbursed business expenses include depreciation to 
which an adjustment is required for Maryland purposes, com­
plete Form 500DM to calculate the addition modification “l” or 
subtraction modification “bb.”

	 FIGURE YOUR MARYLAND TAXABLE NET 	
	 INCOME. 
To find your taxable income you must subtract either the 
standard deduction from the worksheet or the itemized 
deductions you have entered on Line 17 of Form 502. The 
ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD will lower your taxes 
if you have enough deductions. If you are not certain 
about which method to use, figure your tax both ways to 
determine which method is best for you. Check one of the 
deduction method boxes to indicate which method you 
will use.
STANDARD DEDUCTION METHOD
The STANDARD DEDUCTION METHOD gives you a standard de­
duction of 15% of Maryland adjusted gross income (Line 16) 
with minimums of $1,800 and $3,650 and maximums of $2,700 
and $5,450, depending on your filing status. Use STANDARD 
DEDUCTION WORKSHEET (16A) for your filing status to figure 
your standard deduction. Write the result on Line 17 of Form 
502. Then follow the instructions for EXEMPTIONS.
ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD
You may itemize your deductions only if you itemized 
deductions on your federal return. See Instruction 14 for 
completing Lines 17a and b of Form 502. Enter the result on 
Line 17. You are not required to itemize deductions on your 
Maryland return simply because you itemized on your federal 
return. Figure your tax each way to determine which method 
is best for you.
EXEMPTIONS
After completing the EXEMPTIONS area on your return (page 2), 
enter the total exemption amount on Line 19 of Form 502.
PART-YEAR RESIDENTS AND NONRESIDENT MILITARY 
TAXPAYERS
You must adjust your standard or itemized deductions and ex­
emptions. If you are a part-year resident, see Instruction 26. If 
you are a nonresident military member filing a joint return with 
your civilian spouse, see Technical Bulletin 1.

	FIGURE YOUR MARYLAND TAX.
 
You must use the tax tables if your taxable income is less 
than $100,000.
The 2024 Maryland tax rate schedules are shown so you can 
see the tax rate that applies to all levels of income; however, 
do not use them to figure your tax. Instead, use the tax tables 
if your income is under $100,000; otherwise, use the appropri­
ate row in the MARYLAND TAX COMPUTATION WORKSHEET 
SCHEDULES (17A) at the end of the tax tables to figure your 
tax. The tax tables and the MARYLAND TAX COMPUTATION 
WORKSHEET SCHEDULES I AND II have been based on these 
tax rate schedules.
Find the income range in the tax table that applies to the amount 
on Line 20 of Form 502. Find the Maryland tax corresponding to 
your income range. Enter the tax amount on Line 21 of Form 502. 
If your taxable income is $100,000 or more, use the MARYLAND

INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESS TAX CREDITS.
If you claim an earned income credit or poverty level credit, see 
Instruction 19 for your local credit calculation.
Form 500CR Instructions are available online at marylandtaxes.
gov. You must file Form 500CR electronically to claim a business 
income tax credit.
Line 22. EARNED INCOME CREDIT.
If you claimed an earned income credit on your federal return 
or would otherwise have been eligible to claim an earned in­
come credit on your federal return but for you or your spouse 
filing with an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), 
you are eligible for the Maryland earned income credit. If you 
are a married couple filing either a joint or separate Mary­
land return, or you have at least one qualifying child, then you 
may claim one-half (50%) of the federal credit on your Mary­
land return. Individuals filing as single, head of household, 
or qualifying surviving spouse without a qualifying child may 
claim 100% of the federal earned income credit, see Work­
sheet (18A.1) to calculate any refundable earned income tax 
credit. If you are a part-year resident or a member of the mili­
tary, see Instruction 26(o) before completing this worksheet. 
If you do not meet the minimum age requirement under the 
federal credit and are otherwise eligible for the federal credit 
for those without a qualifying child, you may claim the state 
earned income credit (calculate federal earned income credit 
disregarding the minimum age requirement). If you or your 
spouse do not possess a valid SSN but are otherwise eligible 
for the federal credit and are filing your Maryland return us­
ing an ITIN, you may claim the state earned income credit 
by calculating the federal earned income credit disregarding 
the SSN requirement. If you filed a joint federal return but a 
separate Maryland return, you may claim a combined total of 
up to one-half the federal credit. For information on how to 
calculate the amount of the federal earned income credit, visit 
irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p596.pdf.

cal tax for each jurisdiction based on the ratio of each spouse’s 
income to the total income. Also note the words “separate juris­
dictions” on Line 28 of Form 502. If the local tax rates are dif­
ferent, calculate a ratio of each spouse’s income to total income. 
Then apply this ratio to the taxable net income and calculate the

	 OVERPAYMENT OR BALANCE DUE. 


--- Page 28 ---

20
Calculate the Balance Due (Line 45 of Form 502) or 
Overpayment (Line 46 of Form 502). Read instructions 
under UNDERPAYMENT OF ESTIMATED TAX and then go 
to BALANCE DUE or OVERPAYMENT.
UNDERPAYMENT OF ESTIMATED TAX
If you had income from which tax was not withheld or did not have 
enough tax withheld during the year, you may have owed an estimated 
tax. All taxpayers should refer to Form 502UP to determine if they owe 
interest because they underpaid estimated tax during the year.
If you owe interest, complete Form 502UP, write the amount of 
interest (line 18 of Form 502UP) and check the box on Line 49 of 
Form 502. Attach Form 502UP.
Generally, you do not owe interest if: 
a.	 a. you owe less than $500 tax on income that is not subject 
to Maryland withholding;
b.	 b. each current year payment, made quarterly as required, 
is equal to or more than one-fourth of 110% of last year’s 
tax, that was developed; OR
c.	 c. you made quarterly payments during the year that equal 
90% of this year’s tax.
d.	 d. If 90% of your taxable income was taxable to another 
state or your income was received unevenly, see Instruction 
23 for more information.
Special rules apply if your gross income from farming or fish­
ing is at least two-thirds of your total estimated gross income. 
See Form 502UP for additional information and instructions for 
claiming this exemption from interest.
INTEREST FOR LATE FILING 
Interest is due at the rate of 11.4825% annually or 0.9568% 
per month for any month or part of a month that a tax is paid 
after the original due date of the 2024 return but before Janu­
ary 1, 2026. For assistance in calculating interest for tax paid on 
or after January 1, 2026, visit marylandtaxes.gov. Enter any 
interest due on the appropriate line of your tax return. 
- Penalty up to 10% may be assessed by the Comptroller of Mary­
land for failing to pay any tax, or failing to file a tax return, when due. 
TOTAL INTEREST AND PENALTY 
Enter the total of interest for underpayment of estimated tax, 
interest for late filing, and penalty for withdrawal of funds from a 
First Time Homebuyer Savings Account for an ineligible purpose  
on Line 49 of Form 502.
- Enter 10% of the amount of any addition modification attrib­
uted to code letter “s”, First Time Homebuyer Savings Account 
addition, for funds withdrawn for an ineligible purpose.
Note: Funds withdrawn from the account and deposited into a 
new First Time Homebuyer Savings Account or a disbursement 
of assets of a First Time Homebuyer Savings Account under an 
account holder’s bankruptcy filing are not subject to the penalty.
BALANCE DUE 
If you have a balance due, add this amount to any amount on 
Line 49. Enter the total on Line 50. 
Pay your balance due (unless it is less than $1.00). See Instruc­
tions 23 and 24 regarding signatures, attachments, and mailing. 
OVERPAYMENT
If you file Form 502 and have an overpayment on Line 46, the 
Revenue Administration Division will refund any amount of $1.00 
or more. If you want part or all of your overpayment applied to 
your 2025 estimated tax, then write the amount you want ap­
plied on Line 47. Overpayments may first be applied to previous 
years’ tax liabilities or other debts as required by federal or state 
law. If you must pay interest for underpayment of estimated 
tax, enter the amount of interest from Line 18 of Form 502UP on 
Line 49. Subtract Lines 47 and 49 from your overpayment (Line 
46). This is the amount of your refund. Write this amount on Line 
48. No refunds of less than $1.00 will be sent. If the amount on 
Line 49 is more than the overpayment on Line 46 of Form 502, 
enter zero (0) on Lines 47 and 48. Then subtract Line 46 from 
Line 49 and enter the result on Line 50. If you prefer, you may 
leave Line 49 blank and the Revenue Administration Division will 
calculate the interest charges and send you a bill. See Instruc­
tions 23 and 24 regarding signatures, attachments, and mailing.
The length of time you have for claiming a refund is limited. 
See Instruction 28 for more information.
DIRECT DEPOSIT OF REFUND
To comply with banking and National Automated Clearing 
House Association (NACHA) rules, we ask you to indicate by 
checking the appropriate box on your return if the state refund 
is going to an account outside the United States. If you indicate 
that this is the case, STOP! Do not enter your routing and ac­
count numbers, as the direct deposit option is not available to 
you. We will send you a paper check.
By choosing direct deposit of your refund and checking the ap­
propriate box, you authorize the State of Maryland to disclose 
to your bank, to the State’s depository bank and their financial 
partners, and NACHA any tax return information necessary to 
make the deposit, such as your refund amount, your name, and 
the name(s) as it appears on the bank account. Complete Lines 
51a, b, c, and d of Form 502 if you want us to deposit your re­
fund directly into your account at a bank or other financial insti­
tution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) 
in the United States.
Check with your financial institution to make sure your 
direct deposit will be accepted and to get the correct 
routing and account numbers. If you enter the 
incorrect account or omit any required informa­
tion, the State of Maryland will not be responsi­
ble for recovering that refund and/or for making the 
direct deposit payment electronically.
Line 51a.
Check the appropriate box to identify the type of account that 
will be used (checking or savings). You must check one box only 
or a refund check will be mailed.
Line 51b.
The routing number must be nine digits. If the first two digits 
are not 01 through 12 or 21 through 32, the direct deposit will 
be rejected and a check will be mailed.
If you are not sure of the correct routing number or if your check 
states that it is payable through a financial institution different 
from the one at which you have your checking account, contact 
your financial institution for the correct routing number.
Line 51c.
The account number can be up to 17 characters (both numbers 
and letters). Omit spaces, hyphens, and special symbols. Enter 
the number from left to right. If we are notified by the finan­
cial institution that the direct deposit is not successful, a refund 
check will be mailed to you. Have a bank statement for the de­
posit account available if you contact us concerning the direct 
deposit of your refund.
Line 51d.
Indicate the name(s) as it appears on the bank account.
DISCLOSURE By requesting a direct deposit of your Mary­
land tax refund and entering your bank account number, rout­
ing number, account type, and name(s) as it appears on your 
bank account and on your income tax return, you authorize the 
Comptroller’s Office to disclose this information regarding your 
refund amount to the Maryland State Treasurer’s Office (who 
performs banking services for the Comptroller’s Office).
SPLITTING YOUR DIRECT DEPOSIT

ELECTRONICALLY FILING YOUR RETURN
The fastest way to file your return, and receive your refund is

the Revenue Administration Division. You may request elec­
tronic funds withdrawal (direct debit) payments on your 
electronic return. If you both file and pay electronically, your 
return is due April 15th. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sun­
day or legal holiday, the return must be filed by the next busi­
ness day. However, you will have until April 30th to make 
your electronic payment. Note: An online payment where 
the bank mails the Comptroller of Maryland a paper check 
is not considered an electronic payment. You may file your 
return electronically through your personal computer. Do not 
send a paper copy of the return if you electronically filed. 
For more information, visit marylandtaxes.gov.
ELECTRONIC PAYMENT OF BALANCE DUE
If your paper or electronic tax return has a balance due, you 
may pay electronically at marylandtaxes.gov by selecting Bill 
Pay. The amount that you designate will be debited from your 
bank or financial institution on the date that you choose.
PAYMENT BY CHECK OR MONEY ORDER

Maryland.” You must use blue or black ink. Do not use red ink 
or pencil. Write the type of tax and year of tax being paid on 
your check. You must include the Social Security number/ In­
dividual Taxpayer Identification Number of the taxpayer if filing 
individually; if filing jointly, you must include the Social Security

day, the return must be filed by the next business day. You can file

action to obtain an automatic six-month extension. If no tax 
is due and you did not request a federal extension, file your exten­
sion online at marylandtaxes.gov or by phone at 410-260-7829. 
Only submit Form PV if tax is due.

Your return must show all income reported on your  federal re­
turn, regardless of when or where earned. However, you are 
permitted to subtract income received when not a resident of 
Maryland. The following instructions describe the adjustments 
which must be made for a part-year resident return and returns 
filed by certain military taxpayers (see Instruction 29) and mar­
ried couples who file a joint return when one spouse is not a 
resident of Maryland.
a.	 You must file Form 502. 
b.	 Whenever the term “tax year” is used in these instructions, it 
means that portion of the year in which you were a resident of 
Maryland. If you began residence in Maryland in 2024, the last 
day of the “tax year” was December 31, 2024. If you ended 
residence in Maryland in 2024, the last day of the “tax year” 
was the day before you established residence in another state. 
c.	 Complete the name and address information at the top of 
Form 502. On Current Mailing Address Line 1, enter the 
street number and street name of your current address. If 
using a PO Box address, enter “PO Box” and the PO Box num­
ber on Current Mailing Address Line 1. On Current Mailing 
Address Line 2, if applicable enter the floor, suite, or apart­
ment number for your current mailing address. If using a PO 
Box address, leave Current Mailing Address Line 2 blank.
d.	 Complete the Maryland political subdivision information us­
ing Instruction 6. The Maryland political subdivision informa­
tion includes the 4 DIGIT POLITICAL SUBDIVISION CODE, 
MARYLAND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION, MARYLAND PHYSICAL 
ADDRESS LINE 1, MARYLAND PHYSICAL ADDRESS LINE 2, 
CITY, ZIP CODE + 4, and MARYLAND COUNTY fields. Use the 
county, city, town, or taxing area of which you were a resi­
dent on the last day of your Maryland residence. 
e.	 Complete the filing status area using the same filing status 
that you used on your federal return. Married couples who 
file joint federal returns may file separate Maryland returns 
under certain circumstances. See Instruction 7. If you are a 
dependent taxpayer, use filing status 6. 
f.	 Complete the EXEMPTIONS area. Additional exemptions are 
allowed for age and blindness for Maryland purposes which 
will be computed in this area. 
g.	 Complete the Part-year/MILITARY area on the front of Form 
502. Place a “P” in the box and show the dates of residence in 
Maryland. Certain military taxpayers following these instruc­


--- Page 31 ---

23
tions should place an “M” in the box and enter the non-Mary­
land military income. If you are both part-year and military, 
place a “P” and “M” in the box. Married taxpayers with dif­
ferent tax periods filing a joint Maryland return should enter 
a “D” in the box, follow the remainder of this instruction and 
write “different tax periods” in the dates of residence area. 
Married taxpayers who file a joint return when one spouse 
is not a resident of Maryland should place a “P” in the part 
year resident box and enter the name and the other state of 
residence of the nonresident spouse. 
h.	 Enter on Line 1 the adjusted gross income from your federal 
return for the entire year regardless of your length of resi­
dence. 
i.	 Complete the ADDITIONS TO INCOME area using Instruction 
12. If you had losses or adjustments to income on your fed­
eral return, write on Line 5 those loss or adjustment items 
that were realized or paid when you were not a resident of 
Maryland. 
j.	 Complete the SUBTRACTIONS FROM INCOME area using In­
struction 13. You may include only subtractions from 
income that apply to income subject to Maryland tax. 
Include on Line 12 any income received during the part of 
the year when you were not a resident of Maryland. 
k.	 You must adjust your standard or itemized deductions and 
exemptions based on the percentage of your income subject 
to Maryland tax. Complete the MARYLAND INCOME FACTOR 
WORKSHEET (26A) to figure the percentage of Maryland in­
come to total income.
l.	 If you itemize deductions, complete Lines 17a and b. Prorate 
the itemized deductions using the following formula: 
	
NET 
 
MARYLAND

DEDUCTIONS
 
Enter the prorated amount on Line 17 of Form 502 and check 
the ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD box. Another method 
of allocating itemized deductions may be allowed. Send your 
written request along with your completed Maryland return, 
a copy of your federal return including federal Schedule A 
and a copy of the other state’s return. If the other state 
does not have an income tax, then submit a schedule show­
ing the allocation of income and itemized deductions among 
the states. The Maryland return must be completed in ac­
cordance with the alternative method requested. This re­
quest should be sent to the Revenue Administration Division, 
Taxpayer Accounting Section (Special Allocations), P.O. Box 
1829, Annapolis, MD 21404-1829. 
m.	If you are not itemizing deductions, you must use the stan­
dard deduction. The standard deduction must be prorated 
using the Maryland income factor. Calculate the standard 
deduction using a worksheet in Instruction 16. Prorate the 
standard deduction using the following  formula:

	 FILING RETURN OF DECEASED TAXPAYER. 
Enter code 321 on one of the code number lines located to 
the right of the telephone number area on page 4 of Form 
502. Use the following special instructions:
FILING THE RETURN
If an individual required to file an income tax return dies, the 
final income tax return shall be filed: 
a.	 By the personal representative (an executor or administra­
tor) of the individual’s estate; 
b.	 If there is no personal representative, by the decedent’s 
surviving spouse; or, 
c.	 Jointly by the personal representatives of each if both 
spouses are deceased. 
JOINT RETURN
If the spouse of the deceased taxpayer filed a joint federal return 
with the decedent, generally a joint Maryland return must be 
filed. (See Instruction 7.)
The word “DECEASED” and the date of death should be written 
after the decedent’s name at the top of the form. The name and 
title of any person, other than the surviving spouse, filing the 
return should be clearly noted on the form. Attach a copy of the 
Letters of Administration or, if the return is filed solely by the 
surviving spouse, attach a death certificate. 
ALL OTHER RETURNS
If the return is filed by the personal representative, write the 
words “Estate of” before the decedent’s first name and the date 
of death after the last name. The name and title of the person 
filing the return should be clearly noted on the form. Attach a 
copy of the Letter(s) of Administration or federal Form 1310.


--- Page 32 ---

24
Note: A copy of the decedent’s will cannot be accepted as 
evidence that you are the personal representative. The address 
of the person claiming the deceased taxpayer’s refund should be 
written on the Current Mailing Address lines, and the address of 
the deceased taxpayer should be written in the Maryland Physical 
address section on page 1 of Form 502.
If there is no personal representative, write the word “de­
ceased” and the date of death after the decedent’s last name. The 
name and title of the person filing the return should be clearly 
noted on the form, and a copy of federal Form 1310 must be at­
tached if requesting a refund. The form can be found at irs.gov.
KILLED IN ACTION
Maryland will abate the tax liability for an individual who is a 
member of the U.S. Armed Forces at death, and dies while in 
active service in a combat zone or at any place from wounds, dis­
ease, or injury incurred while in active service in a combat zone. 
To obtain an abatement, a return must be filed. The abatement 
will apply to the tax year in which death occurred, and any earlier 
tax year ending on or after the first day the member served in a 
combat zone in active service. 
Maryland will also abate the tax liability of an individual who dies 
while a military or civilian employee of the United States, if such 
death occurs as a result of wounds or injury incurred outside the 
United States in a terrorist or military action. In the case of a 
joint return, Maryland applies the same rules for these taxpay­
ers as does the IRS. For more information on filing a return, see 
Publication 3 Armed Forces Tax Guide available at irs.gov. Place 
code number 915 on one of the lines marked “code numbers” to 
the right of the telephone number area, if you are filing a return 
for a taxpayer who was killed in action meeting the above criteria. 
ESTATE TAX RETURN REQUIRED
In addition to an income tax return, a Maryland estate tax return 
is required for every estate whose federal gross estate, plus cer­
tain additions, equals or exceeds the Maryland estate tax exemp­
tion amount for the year of the decedent’s death. For decedents 
dying in tax year 2019 and later, the Maryland estate tax exemp­
tion amount is $5,000,000. An estate tax return must be filed 
within nine months of the date of death. For more information, 
see the Maryland Estate Tax Return, Form MET-1. 
28
	AMENDED RETURNS.
If you need to change a return that you have already 
filed, or if the IRS changes your return, you must file an 
amended return.
FILING AN AMENDED RETURN
You must file an amended return to make certain changes to 
your original return. These include changes in income, filing sta­
tus, amount of deductions, the number of exemptions, and the 
amount of additions to income and subtractions from income.
Note: Changes made as part of an amended return are subject 
to audit for up to three years from the date the amended return 
is filed.
Use Form 502X to file an amended return and include a copy of 
your federal return. Form 502X and instructions may be obtained 
by visiting marylandtaxes.gov or by calling 410-260-7951.
CHANGES TO YOUR FEDERAL RETURN
If the IRS makes any changes to your federal return, you must 
notify the State of Maryland. Send notification to the Revenue 
Administration Division within 90 days of the final determination 
of the changes by the IRS. If you file an amended federal return 
that changes your Maryland return, you must file an amended 
Maryland return.
IF YOUR ORIGINAL RETURN SHOWED A REFUND
If you expect a refund from your original return, do not file an 
amended return until you have received your refund check. Then 
cash the check; do not return it. If your amended return shows a 
smaller refund, send a check for the difference with the amended 
return. If your amended return shows a larger refund, the Reve­
nue Administration Division will issue an additional refund check.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Do not file an amended return until sufficient time has passed 
to allow the original return to be processed. For current year 
returns, allow at least six weeks. 
Generally, a claim for a refund or overpayment credit must be 
filed within three years from the date the original return was filed 
or within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is 
later. An original return filed early is considered filed on the date 
it was due. If a claim is filed within three years after the date the 
original return was filed, the credit or refund may not be more 
than that part of the tax paid within three years, plus any exten­
sion of time for filing the return, immediately preceding the filing 
of the claim. If a claim is filed after the three year period, but 
within two years from the time the tax was paid, the refund or 
credit may not be more than the tax paid within two years im­
mediately before filing the claim for a refund or credit.
A claim for refund based on a federal net operating loss carryback 
must be filed within three years from the due date of the return 
for the tax year of the net operating loss (farming loss only). 
If the claim for refund resulted from a federal adjustment or final 
decision of a federal court which is more than three years from 
the date of filing the return or more than two years from the time 
the tax was paid, a claim for refund must be filed within one year 
from the date of the adjustment or final decision. 
If the claim for refund resulted from a notification received from 
another state for income taxes due which is more than three 
years from the date of filing the Maryland return or more than 
two years from the time the tax was paid, a claim for refund 
resulting from a credit for taxes paid to that state must be filed 
within one year of the date of the notification that the other 
state’s tax was due.
If the claim for refund or credit for overpayment resulted from 
a final determination made by an administrative board or an ap­
peal of a decision of an administrative board, that is more than 
three years from the date of filing the return or more than two 
years from the time the tax was paid, the claim for refund must 
be filed within one year of the date of the final decision of the ad­
ministrative board or final decision of the highest court to which 
an appeal of the administrative board is taken.
No refund for less than $1.00 will be issued. No payment of less 
than $1.00 is required.

ESTIMATED TAX WORKSHEET INSTRUCTIONS 
Purpose of declaration. The filing of a declaration of estimated 
Maryland income tax is a part of the pay-as-you-go plan of 
income tax collec­tion adopted by the State. If you have any 
income such as pensions, business income, lottery, capital gains, 
interest, dividends, etc., from which no tax is withheld, or wages 
from which not enough Maryland tax is withheld, you may have 
to pay estimated taxes. The law is similar to the federal law.
Who must file a declaration. You must file a declaration of 
estimated tax if you are required to file a Maryland income tax 
return and your gross income would be ex­pected to develop a 
tax of more than $500 in excess of your Maryland withholding.
You must file a declaration with payment in full within 60 days 
of receiving $500 or more of income from awards, prizes, lot­
teries or raffles, whether paid in cash or property if Maryland 
tax has not been withheld. A married couple may file a joint 
declaration. If you are filing a joint declaration, both Social 
Security numbers must be entered. If filing on behalf of a 
minor, the name and Social Security number of the minor 
must be entered.
When to file a declaration. You must pay at least one-
fourth of the total estimated tax on Line 15 of this form on 
or before April 15, 2025. The remaining quarterly payments 
are due June 15, 2025, September 15, 2025 and January 
15, 2026. You may pay the total estimated tax with your first 
payment. If you are filing on a fiscal year basis, each payment 
is due by the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th and 13th months 
following the beginning of the fiscal year.
Overpayment of tax. If you overpaid your 2024 income tax 
(Form 502 or 505), you may apply all or part of the over­
payment to your 2025 estimated tax. If the over­payment ap­
plied equals or exceeds the estimated tax liability for the first 
quarterly payment, you are not required to file the ­declaration. 
If the overpayment applied is less than the estimated tax 
­liability, you should file the declaration and pay the balance 
of the first installment. 
How to estimate your 2025 tax. The worksheet is designed 
to develop an estimate of your 2025 Maryland and local in­
come tax. Be as accurate as you can in forecasting your 2025 
income. You may use your 2024 income tax as a guide, but if 
you will receive more income than you did in 2024, you must 
pay at least 110% of your prior year tax to avoid interest for 
underpayment of estimated tax. For the purpose of estimating, 
rounding all amounts to the nearest dollar is recommended.
Nonresidents who want to estimate 2025 Maryland taxes 
may use the Nonresident Estimate Tax Calculator at 
marylandtaxes.gov.
Specific Instructions
Line 1. Total income expected in 2025 is your estimated federal 
adjusted gross income.
Line 2. Net modifications. You must add certain items to your

instructions. You may subtract certain items from federal ad­
justed gross income. See Instruction 13 of the tax instructions. 
Enter on this line the net result of additions and subtractions.
Line 4. Deductions. You may compute your tax using the 
standard deduction method or the itemized deduction method.
Standard deduction. Compute 15% of Line 3.
If Filing Status 1, 3, 6: If the amount computed is less 
than $1,800, enter $1,800; if the amount is between $1,800 
and $2,700, enter that amount; if the amount is more than 
$2,700, enter $2,700.
If Filing Status 2, 4, 5: If the amount computed is less 
than $3,650, enter $3,650; if the amount is between $3,650 
and $5,450, enter that amount; if the amount is more than 
$5,450, enter $5,450.
Itemized deductions. Enter the total of federal itemized 
deductions less state and local income taxes.

EXTENSION WORKSHEET INSTRUCTIONS
Who must file for an extension?
If you cannot complete and file your Form 502, 505, 510C or 
515 by the due date, you should complete the Tax Payment 
Worksheet to determine if you must file for an extension. If 
Line 6 of the worksheet shows you owe tax, you must file 
Form PV and pay the full amount due by April 15, 2025, (or 
the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the 
tax year). If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal 
holiday, the return must be filed by the next business day.
NOTE: Filing an extension does not extend the time for 
paying your taxes.
Do not file for an extension if, after completing the 
PVW, you find that you do not owe additional tax. 
However, be aware that if an unpaid liability is disclosed 
when you file your return, you may owe penalty and inter­
est charges in addition to the tax. See “Will penalties and 
interest be owed?”.
Automatic Maryland six-month extension
If you filed a federal extension and expect to owe zero tax 
to Maryland we grant you an automatic six-month extension 
of time to file your Form 502, 505, 510C, or 515. You are 
not required to file for an extension in order to obtain 
this automatic extension. However, you should use Form 
PV to pay any tax due of forms 502, 505, and 515, but you 
should use Form EL102B to pay any tax due or payment with 
extension of Form 510C in order to avoid any late-payment 
penalty and interest on tax not paid by April 15, 2025.
Note: In the case of Form 510C, the PVW must be completed 
to estimate the payment.
Requesting a Maryland extension when not requesting 
a ­federal extension:
(1)	
Request your extension by telefile at 410-260-7829 
from Central Maryland or 1-800-260-3664 from else­
where; or,
(2)	
Request your extension at marylandtaxes.gov.
When should Form PV be mailed without a payment?
Never.
When requesting an extension beyond six months:
No extension request will be granted for more than six 
months, except in the case of individuals who are out of the 
United States. Even when an individual is out of the U.S. an 
extension will not be granted for more than one year. An 
extension request for beyond six months without a payment 
should be filed by telefile or on our website. For more infor­
mation, visit marylandtaxes.gov.
When to file: 
If you owe any tax, file Form PV along with your payment 
on or before April 15, 2025. If you are filing on a fiscal year 
basis, file by the regular due date of your return. If any due 
date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the return 
and payment must be filed by the next business day.
How to file: 
For an extension request with payment, use electronic 
funds withdrawal (direct debit) from savings or check­
ing account, or to make payment(s) by credit card, visit 
marylandtaxes.gov; otherwise, make check or money order 
payable to: COMPTROLLER OF MARYLAND.
For returns filed with payments, attach check or money order 
to Form PV. Make check or money order payable to Comptroller 
of Maryland. On your check or money order, you must include 
the Social Security number/Individual Taxpayer Identification 
Number of the taxpayer if filing individually. If filing jointly, you 
must include the Social Security number/Individual Taxpayer 
Identification Number  of the primary taxpayer, tax type, and 
tax year on the check/money order. Failure to include this in­
formation will delay the processing of your payment. 
Mail to:	 Payment Processing
	
PO Box 8888
	
Annapolis, MD 21401-8888
Will penalties and interest be owed?
You will owe interest on tax not paid by the regular due date 
of your return. The interest will accrue until you pay the tax. 
Even if you had a good reason for not paying on time, you will 
still owe interest.
If tax and interest are not paid promptly, a penalty will be as­
sessed on the tax.
When should I include a copy of Form PV if I am requesting an 
extension of time to file? 
Only include Form PV with Form 502, 505, or 515 if you are filing 
an extension request along with a payment by check or money 
order. If you are making an extension payment electronically, you 
do not need to include Form PV. Do not include Form PV to re­
quest an extension if you are not making an extension payment.

HOW TO MAXIMIZE YOUR
Maryland College  
Investment Plan Tax Benefits
Did you know that Maryland 
taxpayers may be eligible for a  
STATE INCOME SUBTRACTION 
if they open a new OR contribute 
to an existing Maryland College 
Investment Plan account?
The Maryland Senator Edward J. Kasemeyer College Investment Plan Disclosure Statement provides investment objectives, risks, expenses and costs, fees, and other 
information you should read and consider carefully before investing. If you or your beneficiary live outside of Maryland, you should compare Maryland 529 to any college 
savings program offered by your home state or your beneficiary’s home state, which may offer state tax or other state benefits such as financial aid, scholarship funds, and 
protection from creditors that are only available for investments in such state’s 529 plan. Tax benefits may be conditioned on meeting certain requirements, such as residency 
purpose for or timing of distributions, or other factors, as applicable. If you receive a State contribution for any account in a given year, you are not eligible in that year for the 
income subtraction on your State taxes for contributions that you made to that or any other College Investment Plan account. You should consult with a tax or legal professional 
for additional information. T. Rowe Price Investment Services, Inc., Distributor/Underwriter of the Maryland Senator Edward J. Kasemeyer College Investment Plan.
*Note that this is a hypothetical scenario assuming a 7.6% State and local tax rate with no federal deduction. 
The amount of savings from your State income subtraction may vary. **Account owners and contributors 
can each subtract contributions regardless of their marital status or tax filing status (individual or joint). A 
contributor need not be a parent or family member of the beneficiary to be eligible for the income subtraction.
Parent 1 opens a Maryland College Investment 
Plan account for a single beneficiary and Parent 2 
makes an additional contribution to the account.
1
2
Maryland taxpayers can receive 
a maximum $2,500 subtraction 
from their State adjusted gross 
income annually per beneficiary for 
contributions to the Investment Plan. 
To take advantage of this Maryland 
income subtraction for a particular 
year, you must make your contribution 
by DECEMBER 31 of that year.
For more information about the  
tax advantages of the Maryland 
College Investment Plan, visit  
Maryland529.com
Each family member who 
opens a new account or 
contributes to an existing 
account may be eligible for 
the income subtraction.

STATE DEPARTMENT OF ASSESSMENTS AND TAXATION 
INFORMATION REGARDING PROPERTY TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS
Under Maryland law, you may be eligible for a substantial credit on the property tax bill issued on your home, based 
upon your gross household income. This program is available to homeowners of all ages and the credit is calculated 
solely on the basis of gross income. The application form is not provided in this income tax booklet because the credits 
are issued as a deduction from the homeowner’s July property tax bill. The property tax credit application forms are 
processed separately by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation.
Use the chart printed below to see if it would be worthwhile for you to submit a Homeowners’ Tax Credit application. If 
the actual property taxes on your home (based on no more than $300,000 of assessed value) exceed the “Tax Limit” 
amount shown on the table below for your household income level, you may be eligible for a credit and are urged to file 
an application. The table is printed for illustrative purposes, and therefore, the income amounts are listed in increments 
of $1,000. For purposes of this program, the applicant must report total income, which means the combined gross 
household income before any deductions are taken. Nontaxable income, such as Social Security, Railroad Retirement, 
or Veterans’ benefits, also must be reported as income for the tax credit program.

* For each additional $1,000 of Income add $90 to $1,680 to find the amount that your tax must exceed.
If you think you might qualify on the basis of your household income, there are certain other legal requirements 
which you must meet. Due to space restrictions, all of the other special limitations cannot be listed in this notice. 
The purpose of this notice is simply to advise you of the availability of the program and to suggest that you inquire 
further if you think you qualify on the basis of the income chart provided above. To obtain a Homeowners’ Tax 
Credit application form or to receive further information about your eligibility for the program, you should 
telephone 410-767-4433 in the Baltimore metropolitan area or 1-800-944-7403 (toll free) for those living 
elsewhere in Maryland. Applications can also be found on the SDAT website at dat.maryland.gov. The deadline for 
filing a Homeowners’ Tax Credit application is generally October 1, 2025.
RENTERS’ TAX CREDIT PROGRAM
The State of Maryland also makes available a Renters’ Tax Credit of up to $1000 a year for renters age 60 and over 
or those 100% disabled if they qualify on the basis of income. Renters under age 60 who have a dependent child 
may be eligible for a credit if certain separate income requirements are met. To obtain a Renters’ Tax Credit 
application form or to receive further information about the program, you may telephone 410-767-4433 
in the Baltimore metropolitan area or 1-800-944-7403 (toll free) for those living elsewhere in Maryland. 
Applications can also be found on the SDAT website at dat.maryland.gov. The filing deadline for the Renter’s Program 
is October 1, 2025.
REAL PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR 100% DISABLED VETERANS AND BLIND PERSONS
There is a complete exemption from real property taxes on the dwelling house owned by disabled veterans with a 
100% service connected permanent disability or by their surviving spouses. The State also allows an exemption on the 
first $15,000 of valuation on the dwelling house owned by legally blind persons.

Assessments and Taxation website at dat.maryland.gov.
