arts, as well as American art, 19th-century

European, and international collections.

Welcome to the Maryland 2024 Tax Year Booklet

Reflecting on the first two years of a four-year term, I am proud that our team has worked to

modernize our agency and engage with Marylanders. We launched Maryland Tax Connect – a

new and improved self-service portal for business tax filing and our agency’s first-ever report on

the State of the Economy! This year’s rotation of covers highlights some of Maryland’s unique

cultural institutions, showcasing our state’s museums that preserve its rich history and culture.

While we couldn’t feature all the incredible museums to visit across Maryland, we proudly cel-

ebrate these three treasured institutions. Read below to learn more and send us your ideas on

the attributes that make Maryland special that we should highlight in the coming years!

The Washington County Museum of Fine Arts

Founded by Anna Brugh Singer and her husband William H. Singer, Jr. in Hagerstown, Maryland,

the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts opened its doors in 1931 and expanded twice - in

1949 and 1994. The firm Hyde & Shepherd designed the building in the neo-Georgian style and

features red brick construction trimmed with local limestone. The American Association of Muse-

ums accredited the museum in 1997 and it is the only art museum in Western Maryland to hold

this honor. The museum’s collection has grown to include over 6,000 art objects.

The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum

The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum was founded in 1965 as a project of the Historical So-

ciety of Talbot County, which obtained three waterfront houses along St. Michael Harbor. The

museum was once a site for seafood packing houses, docks, and work boats, and it currently

houses a wide range of exhibits, artifacts, and vessels from the Chesapeake Bay. The museum

has interactive displays that showcase the Bay’s history and physical and economic environ-

ments. It makes for a great visit for adults and children alike!

The Baltimore Museum of Industry

Founded in 1977, the Baltimore Museum of Industry (BMI) interprets the diverse and significant

human stories behind labor and innovation in Baltimore, cultivating a sense of belonging and in-

spiring visitors to think critically about the intersection of work and society. Located in an 1860s

oyster cannery on a five-acre waterfront campus, the BMI offers dynamic indoor and outdoor

exhibitions, live demonstrations, tours, and hands-on activities for visitors of all ages. Current

exhibitions explore the rise and fall of Bethlehem Steel at Sparrows Point, labor activism and

unions in 21st century Baltimore, and the role of corner bars as social gathering spaces at the

turn of the century.

The Francis Scott Key Bridge spanning Baltimore’s Patapsco River carried workers for nearly a

half century—to steel mills, sugar refineries, and offices downtown. When it collapsed on March

26, 2024, it was being repaired by middle-of-the-night laborers filling potholes so Marylanders

would have a safer ride to their jobs. In response, the museum has launched an oral history

project to preserve the stories of people whose livelihoods have been impacted by the bridge

collapse. The stories and materials collected will form the basis of public programs and a future

long-term exhibition at the BMI about the Port, its history, and the jobs it sustains.

A Message from the Comptroller

Dear Marylander,

Greetings! Thank you for taking the time to review our 2024 Maryland State Tax Forms and

Instructions. We compile this publication each year to help guide Marylanders through the tax filing

process and provide updates on tax code changes.

Our team at the Office of the Comptroller has been hard at work over the last year to begin an important revitalization

in the agency. Guided by our agency-wide vision – to work in partnership to create a state that is more equitable, more

resilient, and more prosperous so that every Marylander can reach their full potential – we set forth an ambitious agenda to

modernize the agency and our infrastructure, obtain much-needed resources to better serve Marylanders throughout the

state, and ensure Maryland is well-positioned for responsible long term economic growth and success.

The Comptroller’s Office released the agency’s inaugural State of the Economy Report in January, using economic data

from 2023. My team led this collaborative effort to better understand the forces at play that have led the state to receive

less revenue in the past year. Future reports will dive into specific areas uncovered by our findings. You can find all our

research reports at marylandtaxes.gov/research to learn more.

As part of a much-needed modernization effort, we have launched Maryland Tax Connect, a self-service portal that now

allows Maryland businesses to file their taxes online with increased ease and security, enabling taxpayers to interact with

the Comptroller’s Office more efficiently. The portal is designed to allow taxpayers to complete essential functions and is

accessible from a mobile device or a desktop. Our goal is for all Maryland taxpayers to be able to pay their state taxes and

track their tax payments in this new system by 2026. For more information, visit marylandtaxes.gov/MDTaxConnect.

Additionally, during the 2025 tax season, eligible Marylanders will be able to file their state and federal taxes for free

through the new Direct File program. Direct File is a new, simple, and secure tax filing software developed by the IRS in

partnership with the Comptroller of Maryland, which will allow eligible taxpayers to prepare and file their tax returns online,

directly with the government. Visit marylandtaxes.gov/directfile to learn more about this and other options available for

Marylanders to file their taxes this year.

I am also pleased to report that we had another successful legislative session this past year. With broad stakeholder support,

and in partnership with Governor Wes Moore, Senate President Bill Ferguson, and Speaker Adrienne Jones, we obtained

additional resources for the Comptroller’s Office, including new positions to advance hiring efforts across the agency and

$8.5 million for cybersecurity, training, audit efforts, equipment upgrades, maintenance, fraud, and accessibility-related

projects, including translation services.

We also passed all six of our priority bills in our legislative package. Over the long term, these bills will help Marylanders

by providing tax assistance funding for low-income residents of Maryland, supporting our agency’s compliance efforts,

preventing and punishing tax preparer scams, promoting online filing, and providing resources to help raise awareness of

personal income tax credits.

We look forward to working with you, your community, or your business. Only by building solid partnerships can we ensure

the growth and thriving of our communities and businesses. Please call our team for assistance at 1-800-MD-TAXES or

email us at taxhelp@marylandtaxes.gov.

Be well and please keep in touch!

My best,

Brooke E. Lierman

WHO MUST FILE?

This booklet and forms are for residents and part-year residents
of Maryland. In general, you must file a Maryland return if you
are or were a resident of Maryland AND you are required to file
a federal return. Information in this section will allow you to
determine if you must file a return and pay taxes as a resident
of Maryland. If you are not a resident but had Maryland tax
withheld or had income from sources in Maryland, you must use
Form 505 or 515, Nonresident Tax return.
WHO IS A RESIDENT?
You are a resident of Maryland if:
a. Your permanent home is or was in Maryland (the law refers
to this as your domicile). OR
b. Your permanent home is outside of Maryland, but you
maintained a place of abode (a place to live) in Maryland for
more than six months of the tax year. If this applies to you
and you were physically present in the state for 183 days or
more, you must file a full-year resident return.
PART-YEAR RESIDENTS
If you began or ended residence in Maryland during the tax year,
you must file a Maryland resident income tax return. See In-
struction 26.
MILITARY AND OTHERS WORKING OUTSIDE OF MARYLAND
Military and other individuals whose domicile is in Maryland, but
who are stationed or work outside of Maryland, including over-
seas, retain their Maryland legal residence. Maryland residency
is not lost because of duty assignments outside of the State; see
Administrative Release 37. Military personnel and their spouses
should see Instruction 29.
TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FILE A
MARYLAND RETURN
a. Add up all of your federal gross income to determine your
total federal income. Gross income is defined in the Internal
Revenue Code and, in general, consists of all income regard-
less of source. It includes wages and other compensation
for services, gross income derived from business, gains (not
losses) derived from dealings in property, interest, rents,
royalties, dividends, alimony, annuities, pensions, income
from partnerships or fiduciaries, etc. If modifications or
deductions reduce your gross income below the mini-
mum filing level, you are still required to file. IRS Pub-
lication 525 provides additional information on taxable and
nontaxable income.
b. Do not include Social Security or railroad retirement ben-
efits in your total federal income.
c. Add to your total federal income any Maryland additions to
MINIMUM FILING LEVELS TABLES
2024

income. Do not include any additions related to periods of
nonresidence. See Instruction 12. This is your Maryland
gross income.
d. If you are a dependent taxpayer, add to your total federal
income any Maryland additions and subtract any Maryland
subtractions. See Instructions 12 and 13. This is your
Maryland gross income.
e. You must file a Maryland return if your Maryland gross in-
come equals or exceeds the income levels in the MINIMUM
FILING LEVEL TABLE 1.
f. If you or your spouse is 65 or over, use the MINIMUM FIL-
ING LEVEL TABLE 2.
g. You must also file a Maryland return if you have Maryland
income tax liability resulting from credits you claimed in a
previous year that are subject to recapture. (See Instruc-
tion for Line 21a.)
IF YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE A MARYLAND RE-
TURN BUT HAD MARYLAND TAXES WITHHELD OR YOU
QUALIFY TO CLAIM A REFUNDABLE CREDIT
To claim a refund for Maryland income taxes withheld or to claim
a refundable credit (see Instruction 21), you must file a Mary-
land return. Taxpayers who are filing for refund only, should
complete all of the information at the top of Form 502 and the
following Lines:
1-
22*, 29*
35-
46, 4 8
*Enter a zero unless: (i) you claim an earned income credit on
your federal return, or (ii) you do not meet the minimum age
requirement under the federal credit, but are otherwise eligible
for the federal credit, for those without a qualifying child.
Attach applicable withholding statements (Forms W-2 and
1099), Form 502CR, and Maryland Schedule K-1 (510/511). The
total amount withheld on all Forms W-2 and 1099 must equal the
withholding you are claiming. Complete direct deposit informa-
tion (Instruction 22) if desired and sign the return.
2
USE OF FEDERAL RETURN.

First complete your 2024 federal income tax return.
You will need information from your federal return to complete
your Maryland return. Complete your federal return before
you continue. Maryland law requires that your income and de-
ductions be entered on your Maryland return exactly as they
were reported on your federal return. If you use federal Form
1040NR, visit marylandtaxes.gov for further information. All
items reported on your Maryland return are subject to verifica-
tion, audit, and revision by the Maryland State Comptroller’s
Office.
3
MARYLAND HEALTHCARE COVERAGE.

The Maryland General Assembly enacted Chapter 423 in the 2019
Session requiring the collection of certain information, including
whether an individual is uninsured at the time the tax return is
filed and whether the individual is interested in having Maryland
Health Connection (“MHC”) determine whether an individual may
be eligible for insurance affordability programs, such as no-cost
or low-cost minimum essential health care coverage.
Check the appropriate box on Form 502 for you and/or your
spouse if you are uninsured as of the date you file your return.
If you would like MHC to determine pre-eligibility for health in-
surance affordability programs for any uninsured member of
your household, you must also check the box on Form 502 indi-
cating you authorize the Comptroller to share information from
your tax return with MHC, which is operated by the Maryland
Health Benefit Exchange.
For each dependent identified on Form 502B, check the appro-
priate box to indicate if that dependent is an uninsured indi-
vidual as of the date the return is filed.
You must provide the date of birth for any uninsured individual
who is interested in obtaining minimum essential health cover-
age.
If you authorize information sharing, we will share the following
information with MHC:
Name, SSN/ITIN, and date of birth of each individual identi-
fied on your return;
Your current mailing address, email address, and phone
number;
Filing status reported on your return;
Total number of individuals in your household included in
your return;
Insured/uninsured status of each individual included in
your return;
Blindness status;
Relationship (self, spouse, or dependent) to the primary tax-
payer for each individual included in your return; and
Your federal adjusted gross income amount from Line 1.
Information shared with MHC will be used to determine eligibil-
ity for insurance affordability programs or to assist with en-
rollment in health coverage. If you would like more informa-
tion about the health insurance affordability programs or health
care coverage enrollment, visit Maryland Health Connection at
marylandhealthconnection.gov/easyenrollment/.
4
NAME AND ADDRESS.

Print using blue or black ink.
Enter your name exactly as entered on your federal tax return.
If you changed your name because of marriage, divorce, etc., be
sure to report the change to the Social Security Administration
before filing your return. This will prevent delays in the process-
ing of your return.
Enter your current address using the spaces provided. On Cur-
rent Mailing Address Line 1, enter the street number and street
name of your current address. If using a PO Box address, enter
“PO Box” and the PO Box number on Current Mailing Address
Line 1. On Current Mailing Address Line 2, if applicable, enter
the floor, suite or apartment number for your current mailing
address. If using a PO Box address, leave Current Mailing Ad-
dress Line 2 blank. Enter City or Town, State, and ZIP Code + 4.
If using a foreign address, complete the lines indicated
for Country Name, Province/State/County, and Postal
Code.
5
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER(S) (SSN).

It is important that you enter each digit of your Social
Security number in the space provided at the top of your
tax return. Missing or unreadable digits will delay the
processing of your return. Your name must match the
name on your current Social Security card to ensure you
receive your personal exemption. If your name does not
match the name on your Social Security card, contact the
federal Social Security Administration at 800-722-1213,
or visit ssa.gov.
The Social Security number(s) must be a valid number issued
by the Social Security Administration of the United States Gov-
ernment. If you, your spouse, or dependent(s) do not have a
Social Security number and you are not eligible to get a SSN,
you must apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification
Number (ITIN) with the IRS and you should wait until
you have received it before you file; and enter it wherever
your Social Security number is requested on the return.
A missing or incorrect SSN or ITIN could result in the disallow-
ance of any credits or exemptions you may be entitled to and
result in a balance due.
A valid SSN or ITIN is required for any claim or exemption for a
dependent. If you have a dependent who was placed with you
for legal adoption and you do not know their SSN, you must get
an Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN) for the de-
pendent from the IRS.
If your child was born and died in this tax year and you do not
have a SSN for the child, complete just the name and relation-
ship of the dependent and enter code 322 , on one of the code
number lines located to the right of the telephone number area
on page 4 of the form; attach a copy of the child’s death certifi-
cate to your return.
6
MARYLAND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION
INFORMATION (REQUIRED).
Fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address of the taxing
area as of December 31, 2024, including political subdivision lines,
based on your residence on the last day of the taxable period.
Part-year residents fill in the lines for your Maryland physical ad-
dress, including political subdivision lines, based on your last day
of residence in Maryland in the taxable period. Military personnel
who are legal residents of Maryland should fill in the lines for your
Maryland physical address, including political subdivision lines,
based on the Maryland physical address that is used for claiming
Maryland as your Home of Record on file with the Defense Finance
and Accounting Service for tax year 2024.
Find your 4-Digit Political Subdivision Code in the LIST
OF INCORPORATED CITIES, TOWNS, AND TAXING AR-
EAS IN MARYLAND and enter this number on the 4 DIGIT
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION CODE line.
When selecting the 4 Digit Political Subdivision Code, be
sure that you have selected the proper political subdivi-
sion from the LIST OF INCORPORATED CITIES, TOWNS
AND TAXING AREAS IN MARYLAND. Do not rely on your
ZIP Code + 4 to identify the proper political subdivision.
For example, most residents within the ZIP Code of Upper
Marlboro do not reside in the political subdivision of the
Town of Upper Marlboro. Therefore, entering the Town of
Upper Marlboro on the 4 DIGIT POLITICAL SUBDIVISION
CODE line for those with a ZIP Code in Upper Marlboro
may not be correct. Also, some political subdivisions have
similar names such as Bel Air in Allegany County and
Town of Bel Air in Harford County or Town of Chevy Chase
and Town of Chevy Chase View. You may contact your
county seat for further information relating to the incor-
porated boundaries of incorporated cities, towns, and
taxing areas in your county.

EXEMPTION AMOUNT CHART (10A)
The personal exemption is $3,200. This exemption is reduced once the taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000 ($150,
if filing Joint, Head of Household, or Qualifying Surviving Spouse with Dependent Child). This reduction applies to the additional dependency
exemptions as well; however, it does not apply to the taxpayer’s age or blindness exemption of $1,000. Use the chart to determine the
allowable exemption amount based upon the filing status. NOTE : For certain taxpayers with interest from U.S. obligations see Instruction 13,

If your spouse does not have and is not required to have a Social Security number or
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number enter “999-00-9999” in the space for your
spouse’s Social Security number (for the purpose of this form ONLY).
If you itemized your deductions on the joint federal return, one
spouse may use the standard deduction and the other spouse
may claim those deductions on the federal return that are “at-
tributable exclusively” to that spouse, plus a prorated amount
of the remaining deductions. If it is not possible to determine
these deductions, the deduction must be allocated proportion-
ately based on your share of the income.
“Attributable exclusively” means that the individual is solely
responsible for the payment of an expense claimed as an item-
ized deduction, including compliance with a valid court order or
separation agreement; or the individual jointly responsible for
the payment of an expense claimed as an itemized deduction
can demonstrate payment of the full amount of the deduction
with funds that are not attributable in whole or in part, to the
other jointly responsible individual.
If both spouses choose to itemize on their separate Maryland
returns, then each spouse must determine which deductions
are attributable exclusively to each spouse and prorate the
remaining deductions using the Maryland Income Factor. See
Instruction 26k. If it is not possible to determine deductions
in this manner, they must be allocated proportionately based
on their respective shares of the income. The total amount of
itemized deductions for both spouses cannot exceed the item-
ized deductions on the federal return.
If you choose to use the standard deduction method, use STAN-
DARD DEDUCTION WORKSHEET (16A) in Instruction 16. Each
spouse must claim their own personal exemption. Each spouse may
allocate the dependent exemptions in any manner they choose. A
dependent may not be claimed twice. The total number of depen-
dents claimed may not exceed the overall number of dependents.
Complete the remainder of the form using the instructions for
each line. Each spouse should claim their own withholding and
other credits. Joint estimated tax paid may be divided between
the spouses in any manner provided the total claimed does not
exceed the total estimated tax paid.

EXEMPTIONS.

Determine what exemptions you are entitled to and complete the
EXEMPTIONS area on Form 502. Form 502B must be completed
and attached to Form 502 if you are claiming one or more
dependents.
EXEMPTIONS ALLOWED
You are entitled to claim qualified exemptions on your Maryland
return. The amount of your Maryland exemption may be limited
by the amount of your federal adjusted gross income. See Ex-
emption Amount Chart (10A).
You and your spouse are permitted to claim additional exemptions
if, on the last day of the taxable year, you or your spouse is age 65
or older or blind. These additional exemptions are in the amount of
$1,000 each. An individual who turns 65 or becomes blind after the
last day of the taxable year, but before they file their return, does
not qualify for the additional exemption. If any other dependent
claimed is 65 or over, you also receive an additional exemption of
up to $3,200. Make sure you check both boxes (4) and (5) of Form
502B for each of your dependents who are age 65 or over. You must
provide the date(s) of birth for all individuals listed on the 502B.
Enter the number of exemptions in the appropriate boxes based
upon your entries in Parts A, B and C of the exemption area of
the form. Enter the total number of exemptions in Part D. The
number of exemptions for Part C is from Total Dependent
Exemptions, Line 3 of Form 502B.

This subtraction applies only if:
a. You were 65 or over or totally disabled, or your spouse was
totally disabled, on the last day of the tax year, AND
b. You included on your federal return taxable income received
as a pension, annuity, or endowment from an “employee
retirement system” qualified under Sections 401(a), 403 or
457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. [A traditional IRA, a
Roth IRA, a rollover IRA, a simplified employee plan (SEP),

Note: For additional information regarding qualified plans pen-
sion exclusion, refer to FAQs #2 on page iii Resident Booklet;
and Form 502R Instructions; and the chart of Form 502R.
Each spouse who receives taxable pension or annuity income
and is 65 or over or totally disabled may be entitled to this ex-
clusion. In addition, if you receive taxable pension or annuity
income but you are not 65 or totally disabled, you may be enti-
tled to this exclusion if your spouse is totally disabled. Complete
a separate column in the PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION
WORKSHEET (13A) for each spouse. Combine your allowable ex-
clusion and enter the total amount on Line 10a, Form 502. On

and/or spouse.
To be considered totally disabled, you must have a mental or
physical impairment which prevents you from engaging in sub-
stantial gainful activity. You must expect the impairment to be
of long, continued, or indefinite duration or to result in your
death. You must attach to your return a certification from a
qualified physician stating the nature of your impairment and
that you are totally disabled. If you have previously submitted
a physician’s certification, attach your own statement that you
are still totally disabled and that a physician’s certification was
submitted before.
If you are a part-year resident, complete PENSION EXCLUSION
COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A) using total taxable pension
and total Social Security and railroad retirement benefits as if
you were a full-year resident. Prorate the amount on Line 5 by
the number of months of Maryland residence divided by 12.
However, if you began to receive your pension during the tax
year you became a Maryland resident, use a proration factor of
the number of months you were a resident divided by the num-
ber of months the pension was received.
For example, Pat Taxpayer moved to Maryland on March 1. If
he started to receive his pension on March 1, he would prorate
the pension exclusion by 10/10, which would mean he would be
entitled to the full pension exclusion. However, if he began to
receive his pension on February 1, Pat would prorate his pen-
sion by 10/11. Note that, in any case, the proration factor may
not exceed 1.
Complete the PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORK-
SHEET (13A). Copy the amount from Line 5 of the worksheet
onto Line 10a, Form 502. On Line 10a, Form 502 check the ap-
plicable box(es) for yourself and/or spouse.
Note: You must complete and attach Form 502R to Form 502 if
you or your spouse are claiming a pension exclusion on Line 10a
of Form 502. See Form 502R for additional information.
Line 10b. PENSION EXCLUSION FOR RETIRED FOREST/
PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER. An individual taxpayer may not
claim BOTH the standard Pension Exclusion and the Pension Ex-
clusion for Retired Forest/Park/Wildlife Ranger. If you are 65 or
older on the last day of the calendar year, you are totally dis-
abled, or your spouse is totally disabled, and you have received
qualified pension income, you should complete the PENSION
EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A) regardless of
your prior work history. It is permissible for one spouse to claim
the standard Pension Exclusion and the other spouse to claim
the Pension Exclusion for Retired Forest/Park/Wildlife Ranger, if
each spouse meets the applicable required criteria.

If you meet the following criteria, use the RETIRED FOREST/
PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTA-
TION WORKSHEET (13E) to calculate your eligible pension ex-
clusion:

a. You were 55 or over on the last day of the tax year,
AND
b. You were not 65 or older, or totally disabled, or have a
spouse who is totally disabled, AND
c. You included on your federal return taxable income
received as a pension, annuity, or endowment from an
“employee retirement system” qualified under Section
401(a), 403 or 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (a
traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, a rollover IRA, a simpli-
fied employee plan (SEP), a Keogh plan, an ineligible
deferred compensation plan for foreign retirement in-
come does not qualify.), AND
d. The retirement income is attributable to your service
as a Forest/Park/Wildlife Ranger of the United States,
the State of Maryland or a political subdivision of
Maryland.
Each spouse who meets the above requirements may be
entitled to the exclusion. If each spouse is eligible, com-
plete a separate column on the RETIRED FOREST/PARK/
WILDLIFE RANGER PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION
WORKSHEET (13E). Combine your allowable exclusions
from Line 8 of the worksheet and enter the total amount
on Line 10b, Form 502. On Line 10b, Form 502 check the
applicable box(es) for yourself and/or spouse.

If you are a part-year resident, complete the RETIRED
FOREST/PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER PENSION EXCLUSION
COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13E) using total taxable pen-
sion and total Social Security and railroad retirement ben-
efits as if you were a full-year resident. Prorate the amount
on Line 8 by the number of months of Maryland residence
divided by 12. However, if you began to receive your pen-
sion during the tax year you became a Maryland resident,
use a proration factor of the number of months you were
a resident divided by the number of months the pension
was received. Copy the prorated amount from Line 8 of the
worksheet onto Line 10b, Form 502.

For example, Pat Taxpayer moved to Maryland on March 1.
If he started to receive his pension on March 1, he would
prorate the pension exclusion by 10/10, which would mean
he would be entitled to the full pension exclusion. However,
if he began to receive his pension on February 1, Pat would
prorate his pension by 10/11. In any case, the prorated fac-
tor may not exceed 1.

Note: You must complete and attach Form 502R to the
Form 502 if you and/or your spouse are claiming a pension
exclusion on Line 10b of Form 502. See the Form 502R for
additional information.

ROAD RETIREMENT BENEFITS. If you included in your fed-
eral adjusted gross income Social Security, Tier I, Tier II and/
or supplemental railroad retirement benefits, then you must in-
clude the total amount of such benefits on Line 11. Social Secu-
rity and railroad retirement benefits are exempt from state tax.

Note: You must complete and attach Form 502R to the Form
502 if you or your spouse received any income during the tax

year (taxable or nontaxable) from Social Security or Railroad
Retirement (Tier I or Tier II). See Form 502R for additional in-
formation.
Line 12. NONRESIDENT INCOME. If you began or ended your
residence in Maryland during the year, you may subtract the
portion of your income received when you were not a resident
of Maryland. See Instruction 26 for part-year residents and
Technical Bulletin 1 for military personnel.
If your state of residence or your period of Maryland residence
was not the same as that of your spouse and you filed a joint
return, follow Instruction 26 (c) through (p).

tion on the Form 502SU. Also, in order to claim the sub-
traction modification, the system that is purchased must be

Environment Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland §
9-1108.

hh. Exemption adjustment for certain taxpayers with inter-
est on U.S. obligations. If you have received income from
U.S. obligations and your federal adjusted gross income
exceeds $100,000 ($150,000 if filing joint, head of house-
hold, or qualifying surviving spouse, enter the difference, if
any, between the exemption amount based on your federal
adjusted gross income and the exemption amount based
upon your federal adjusted gross income after subtracting
your U.S. obligations using the EXEMPTION ADJUSTMENT
WORKSHEET (13C).

If the amount is greater than zero (0), enter this amount as a
subtraction on Line hh of Form 502SU.

Example:
Pat and Chris Jones had a federal adjusted gross income of
$180,000. They also had $40,000 on interest from U.S. Sav-
ings Bonds and had a dependent son whom they claimed on the
Maryland tax return. Using Instruction 10, they found the exemp-
tion amount on their Maryland return (based upon $180,000 of
income) was $2,400 ($800 for three exemptions). If it were not
for the $40,000 of U.S. Savings Bonds, their federal adjusted
gross income would have been $140,000 and their exemption
amount would have been $9,600 ($3,200 for three exemptions).
Therefore, Pat and Chris Jones are entitled to claim a subtraction
of $7,200 ($9,600 - $2,400) on Line hh of Form 502SU.

If you figure your tax by the ITEMIZED DEDUCTION
METHOD, complete Lines 17a and b on Form 502. (See In-
struction 16 to see if you will use the ITEMIZED DEDUC-
TION METHOD.)
Copy the amount from federal Form 1040, Schedule A, Line 17,
Total Itemized Deductions, on Line 17a of Form 502. Certain
items of federal itemized deductions are not eligible for State
purposes and must be subtracted from Line 17a. State and local
income taxes used as a deduction for federal purposes must be
entered on Line 17b (there are certain limitations on the deduc-
tion amount of state and local tax. For more information, visit
marylandtaxes.gov ). Also, any amounts deducted as contri-
butions of Preservation or Conservation Easements for which a
credit is claimed must be added to Line 17b.
You are not required to itemize deductions on your Maryland
return because you have itemized deductions on your federal
return. Figure your tax each way to determine which method is
best for you.
If your unreimbursed business expenses include depreciation to
which an adjustment is required for Maryland purposes, com-
plete Form 500DM to calculate the addition modification “l” or

To find your taxable income you must subtract either the
standard deduction from the worksheet or the itemized
deductions you have entered on Line 17 of Form 502. The
ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD will lower your taxes
if you have enough deductions. If you are not certain
about which method to use, figure your tax both ways to
determine which method is best for you. Check one of the
deduction method boxes to indicate which method you
will use.
STANDARD DEDUCTION METHOD
The STANDARD DEDUCTION METHOD gives you a standard de-
duction of 15% of Maryland adjusted gross income (Line 16)
with minimums of $1,800 and $3,650 and maximums of $2,700
and $5,450, depending on your filing status. Use STANDARD
DEDUCTION WORKSHEET (16A) for your filing status to figure
your standard deduction. Write the result on Line 17 of Form
Then follow the instructions for EXEMPTIONS.
ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD
You may itemize your deductions only if you itemized
deductions on your federal return. See Instruction 14 for
completing Lines 17a and b of Form 502. Enter the result on
Line 17. You are not required to itemize deductions on your
Maryland return simply because you itemized on your federal
return. Figure your tax each way to determine which method
is best for you.

Line 22. EARNED INCOME CREDIT.
If you claimed an earned income credit on your federal return
or would otherwise have been eligible to claim an earned in-
come credit on your federal return but for you or your spouse
filing with an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN),
you are eligible for the Maryland earned income credit. If you
are a married couple filing either a joint or separate Mary-
land return, or you have at least one qualifying child, then you
may claim one-half (50%) of the federal credit on your Mary-
land return. Individuals filing as single, head of household,
or qualifying surviving spouse without a qualifying child may
claim 100% of the federal earned income credit, see Work-
sheet (18A.1) to calculate any refundable earned income tax
credit. If you are a part-year resident or a member of the mili-
tary, see Instruction 26(o) before completing this worksheet.
If you do not meet the minimum age requirement under the
federal credit and are otherwise eligible for the federal credit
for those without a qualifying child, you may claim the state
earned income credit (calculate federal earned income credit
disregarding the minimum age requirement). If you or your
spouse do not possess a valid SSN but are otherwise eligible
for the federal credit and are filing your Maryland return us-
ing an ITIN, you may claim the state earned income credit
by calculating the federal earned income credit disregarding
the SSN requirement. If you filed a joint federal return but a
separate Maryland return, you may claim a combined total of
up to one-half the federal credit. For information on how to
calculate the amount of the federal earned income credit, visit
irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p596.pdf.

Maryland return or have at least one qualifying child, complete

OVERPAYMENT OR BALANCE DUE.

Calculate the Balance Due (Line 45 of Form 502) or
Overpayment (Line 46 of Form 502). Read instructions
under UNDERPAYMENT OF ESTIMATED TAX and then go
to BALANCE DUE or OVERPAYMENT.

UNDERPAYMENT OF ESTIMATED TAX

If you had income from which tax was not withheld or did not have
enough tax withheld during the year, you may have owed an estimated
tax. All taxpayers should refer to Form 502UP to determine if they owe
interest because they underpaid estimated tax during the year.

If you owe interest, complete Form 502UP, write the amount of
interest (line 18 of Form 502UP) and check the box on Line 49 of
Form 502. Attach Form 502UP.

Generally, you do not owe interest if:

a. a. you owe less than $500 tax on income that is not subject
to Maryland withholding;
b. b. each current year payment, made quarterly as required,
is equal to or more than one-fourth of 110% of last year’s
tax, that was developed; OR
c. c. you made quarterly payments during the year that equal
90% of this year’s tax.
d. d. If 90% of your taxable income was taxable to another
state or your income was received unevenly, see Instruction
23 for more information.
Special rules apply if your gross income from farming or fish-
ing is at least two-thirds of your total estimated gross income.
See Form 502UP for additional information and instructions for
claiming this exemption from interest.

INTEREST FOR LATE FILING

Interest is due at the rate of 11.4825% annually or 0.9568%
per month for any month or part of a month that a tax is paid
after the original due date of the 2024 return but before Janu-
ary 1, 2026. For assistance in calculating interest for tax paid on
or after January 1, 2026, visit marylandtaxes.gov. Enter any
interest due on the appropriate line of your tax return.

Penalty up to 10% may be assessed by the Comptroller of Mary-
land for failing to pay any tax, or failing to file a tax return, when due.
TOTAL INTEREST AND PENALTY
Enter the total of interest for underpayment of estimated tax,
interest for late filing, and penalty for withdrawal of funds from a
First Time Homebuyer Savings Account for an ineligible purpose
on Line 49 of Form 502.

Enter 10% of the amount of any addition modification attrib-
uted to code letter “s”, First Time Homebuyer Savings Account
addition, for funds withdrawn for an ineligible purpose.
Note: Funds withdrawn from the account and deposited into a
new First Time Homebuyer Savings Account or a disbursement
of assets of a First Time Homebuyer Savings Account under an
account holder’s bankruptcy filing are not subject to the penalty.

BALANCE DUE

If you have a balance due, add this amount to any amount on
Line 49. Enter the total on Line 50.

Pay your balance due (unless it is less than $1.00). See Instruc-
tions 23 and 24 regarding signatures, attachments, and mailing.

OVERPAYMENT

If you file Form 502 and have an overpayment on Line 46, the
Revenue Administration Division will refund any amount of $1.00
or more. If you want part or all of your overpayment applied to
your 2025 estimated tax, then write the amount you want ap-
plied on Line 47. Overpayments may first be applied to previous
years’ tax liabilities or other debts as required by federal or state
law. If you must pay interest for underpayment of estimated
tax, enter the amount of interest from Line 18 of Form 502UP on
Line 49. Subtract Lines 47 and 49 from your overpayment (Line
46). This is the amount of your refund. Write this amount on Line

No refunds of less than $1.00 will be sent. If the amount on
Line 49 is more than the overpayment on Line 46 of Form 502,
enter zero (0) on Lines 47 and 48. Then subtract Line 46 from
Line 49 and enter the result on Line 50. If you prefer, you may
leave Line 49 blank and the Revenue Administration Division will
calculate the interest charges and send you a bill. See Instruc-
tions 23 and 24 regarding signatures, attachments, and mailing.
The length of time you have for claiming a refund is limited.
See Instruction 28 for more information.
DIRECT DEPOSIT OF REFUND
To comply with banking and National Automated Clearing
House Association (NACHA) rules, we ask you to indicate by
checking the appropriate box on your return if the state refund
is going to an account outside the United States. If you indicate
that this is the case, STOP! Do not enter your routing and ac-
count numbers, as the direct deposit option is not available to
you. We will send you a paper check.
By choosing direct deposit of your refund and checking the ap-
propriate box, you authorize the State of Maryland to disclose
to your bank, to the State’s depository bank and their financial
partners, and NACHA any tax return information necessary to
make the deposit, such as your refund amount, your name, and
the name(s) as it appears on the bank account. Complete Lines
51a, b, c, and d of Form 502 if you want us to deposit your re-
fund directly into your account at a bank or other financial insti-
tution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union)
in the United States.
Check with your financial institution to make sure your
direct deposit will be accepted and to get the correct
routing and account numbers. If you enter the
incorrect account or omit any required informa-
tion, the State of Maryland will not be responsi-
ble for recovering that refund and/or for making the
direct deposit payment electronically.
Line 51a.
Check the appropriate box to identify the type of account that
will be used (checking or savings). You must check one box only
or a refund check will be mailed.
Line 51b.
The routing number must be nine digits. If the first two digits
are not 01 through 12 or 21 through 32, the direct deposit will
be rejected and a check will be mailed.
If you are not sure of the correct routing number or if your check
states that it is payable through a financial institution different
from the one at which you have your checking account, contact
your financial institution for the correct routing number.
Line 51c.
The account number can be up to 17 characters (both numbers
and letters). Omit spaces, hyphens, and special symbols. Enter
the number from left to right. If we are notified by the finan-
cial institution that the direct deposit is not successful, a refund
check will be mailed to you. Have a bank statement for the de-
posit account available if you contact us concerning the direct
deposit of your refund.
Line 51d.

DISCLOSURE By requesting a direct deposit of your Mary-
land tax refund and entering your bank account number, rout-
ing number, account type, and name(s) as it appears on your
bank account and on your income tax return, you authorize the
Comptroller’s Office to disclose this information regarding your
refund amount to the Maryland State Treasurer’s Office (who
performs banking services for the Comptroller’s Office).
SPLITTING YOUR DIRECT DEPOSIT

posit information on your income tax return. Instead, you must

ELECTRONIC FILING, MAILING AND
PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS, DEADLINES
AND EXTENSION.
ELECTRONICALLY FILING YOUR RETURN
The fastest way to file your return, and receive your refund is
to file electronically and request direct deposit. If you request
direct deposit on your electronic return, your refund should be
in your bank account within 72 hours of acknowledgment from
the Revenue Administration Division. You may request elec-
tronic funds withdrawal (direct debit) payments on your
electronic return. If you both file and pay electronically, your
return is due April 15th. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sun-
day or legal holiday, the return must be filed by the next busi-
ness day. However, you will have until April 30th to make
your electronic payment. Note: An online payment where
the bank mails the Comptroller of Maryland a paper check
is not considered an electronic payment. You may file your
return electronically through your personal computer. Do not
send a paper copy of the return if you electronically filed.
For more information, visit marylandtaxes.gov.
ELECTRONIC PAYMENT OF BALANCE DUE
If your paper or electronic tax return has a balance due, you
may pay electronically at marylandtaxes.gov by selecting Bill
Pay. The amount that you designate will be debited from your
bank or financial institution on the date that you choose.
PAYMENT BY CHECK OR MONEY ORDER
Make your check or money order payable to “Comptroller of
Maryland.” You must use blue or black ink. Do not use red ink
or pencil. Write the type of tax and year of tax being paid on
your check. You must include the Social Security number/ In-
dividual Taxpayer Identification Number of the taxpayer if filing
individually; if filing jointly, you must include the Social Security
number/ Individual Taxpayer Identification Number if the pri-
mary taxpayer on the check. Failure to include this information
will delay the processing of your payment.
DO NOT SEND CASH.

Form PV. Do not attach the check or money order to your return.

ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS

ments for the purpose of the April 30th extended due date if
you filed your return electronically by April 15th. If the due date
falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return must be
filed by the next business day.

ELECTRONIC 1099G

email in January that your 1099G is available to be viewed and
printed at marylandtaxes.gov , if you are a registered user.

Note: We can only honor your request on an electronically-filed
return or through your registered request on our website. If you
are filing a tax form by paper, we do not capture this request
and therefore cannot honor your request to send you an elec-
tronic Form 1099G under current IRS regulations.

filed by certain military taxpayers (see Instruction 29) and mar-
ried couples who file a joint return when one spouse is not a
resident of Maryland.
a. You must file Form 502.
b. Whenever the term “tax year” is used in these instructions, it
means that portion of the year in which you were a resident of
Maryland. If you began residence in Maryland in 2024, the last

residence in Maryland in 2024, the last day of the “tax year”
was the day before you established residence in another state.

county, city, town, or taxing area of which you were a resi-
dent on the last day of your Maryland residence.
e. Complete the filing status area using the same filing status
that you used on your federal return. Married couples who
file joint federal returns may file separate Maryland returns
under certain circumstances. See Instruction 7. If you are a
dependent taxpayer, use filing status 6.
f. Complete the EXEMPTIONS area. Additional exemptions are
allowed for age and blindness for Maryland purposes which
will be computed in this area.
g. Complete the Part-year/MILITARY area on the front of Form
Place a “P” in the box and show the dates of residence in
Maryland. Certain military taxpayers following these instruc-
tions should place an “M” in the box and enter the non-Mary-

place a “P” and “M” in the box. Married taxpayers with dif-
ferent tax periods filing a joint Maryland return should enter
a “D” in the box, follow the remainder of this instruction and
write “different tax periods” in the dates of residence area.

FILING RETURN OF DECEASED TAXPAYER.

Enter code 321 on one of the code number lines located to
the right of the telephone number area on page 4 of Form
502. Use the following special instructions:

FILING THE RETURN
If an individual required to file an income tax return dies, the
final income tax return shall be filed:
a. By the personal representative (an executor or administra-
tor) of the individual’s estate;
b. If there is no personal representative, by the decedent’s
surviving spouse; or,
c. Jointly by the personal representatives of each if both
spouses are deceased.
JOINT RETURN
If the spouse of the deceased taxpayer filed a joint federal return
with the decedent, generally a joint Maryland return must be
filed. (See Instruction 7.)
The word “DECEASED” and the date of death should be written
after the decedent’s name at the top of the form. The name and
title of any person, other than the surviving spouse, filing the
return should be clearly noted on the form. Attach a copy of the
Letters of Administration or, if the return is filed solely by the
surviving spouse, attach a death certificate.
ALL OTHER RETURNS
If the return is filed by the personal representative, write the
words “Estate of” before the decedent’s first name and the date
of death after the last name. The name and title of the person
filing the return should be clearly noted on the form. Attach a
copy of the Letter(s) of Administration or federal Form 1310.
Note: A copy of the decedent’s will cannot be accepted as
evidence that you are the personal representative. The address
of the person claiming the deceased taxpayer’s refund should be
written on the Current Mailing Address lines, and the address of
the deceased taxpayer should be written in the Maryland Physical
address section on page 1 of Form 502.
If there is no personal representative , write the word “de-
ceased” and the date of death after the decedent’s last name. The
name and title of the person filing the return should be clearly
noted on the form, and a copy of federal Form 1310 must be at-
tached if requesting a refund. The form can be found at irs.gov.
KILLED IN ACTION
Maryland will abate the tax liability for an individual who is a
member of the U.S. Armed Forces at death, and dies while in
active service in a combat zone or at any place from wounds, dis-
ease, or injury incurred while in active service in a combat zone.
To obtain an abatement, a return must be filed. The abatement
will apply to the tax year in which death occurred, and any earlier
tax year ending on or after the first day the member served in a
combat zone in active service.
Maryland will also abate the tax liability of an individual who dies
while a military or civilian employee of the United States, if such
death occurs as a result of wounds or injury incurred outside the
United States in a terrorist or military action. In the case of a
joint return, Maryland applies the same rules for these taxpay-
ers as does the IRS. For more information on filing a return, see
Publication 3 Armed Forces Tax Guide available at irs.gov. Place
code number 915 on one of the lines marked “code numbers” to
the right of the telephone number area, if you are filing a return
for a taxpayer who was killed in action meeting the above criteria.
ESTATE TAX RETURN REQUIRED
In addition to an income tax return, a Maryland estate tax return
is required for every estate whose federal gross estate, plus cer-
tain additions, equals or exceeds the Maryland estate tax exemp-
tion amount for the year of the decedent’s death. For decedents
dying in tax year 2019 and later, the Maryland estate tax exemp-
tion amount is $5,000,000. An estate tax return must be filed
within nine months of the date of death. For more information,
see the Maryland Estate Tax Return, Form MET-1.
28
AMENDED RETURNS.

If you need to change a return that you have already
filed, or if the IRS changes your return, you must file an
amended return.
FILING AN AMENDED RETURN
You must file an amended return to make certain changes to
your original return. These include changes in income, filing sta-
tus, amount of deductions, the number of exemptions, and the
amount of additions to income and subtractions from income.
Note : Changes made as part of an amended return are subject
to audit for up to three years from the date the amended return
is filed.
Use Form 502X to file an amended return and include a copy of
your federal return. Form 502X and instructions may be obtained
by visiting marylandtaxes.gov or by calling 410-260-7951.
CHANGES TO YOUR FEDERAL RETURN
If the IRS makes any changes to your federal return, you must
notify the State of Maryland. Send notification to the Revenue
Administration Division within 90 days of the final determination
of the changes by the IRS. If you file an amended federal return
that changes your Maryland return, you must file an amended
Maryland return.
IF YOUR ORIGINAL RETURN SHOWED A REFUND
If you expect a refund from your original return, do not file an
amended return until you have received your refund check. Then
cash the check; do not return it. If your amended return shows a
smaller refund, send a check for the difference with the amended
return. If your amended return shows a larger refund, the Reve-
nue Administration Division will issue an additional refund check.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Do not file an amended return until sufficient time has passed
to allow the original return to be processed. For current year
returns, allow at least six weeks.
Generally, a claim for a refund or overpayment credit must be
filed within three years from the date the original return was filed
or within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is
later. An original return filed early is considered filed on the date
it was due. If a claim is filed within three years after the date the
original return was filed, the credit or refund may not be more
than that part of the tax paid within three years, plus any exten-
sion of time for filing the return, immediately preceding the filing
of the claim. If a claim is filed after the three year period, but
within two years from the time the tax was paid, the refund or
credit may not be more than the tax paid within two years im-
mediately before filing the claim for a refund or credit.
A claim for refund based on a federal net operating loss carryback
must be filed within three years from the due date of the return
for the tax year of the net operating loss (farming loss only).
If the claim for refund resulted from a federal adjustment or final
decision of a federal court which is more than three years from
the date of filing the return or more than two years from the time
the tax was paid, a claim for refund must be filed within one year
from the date of the adjustment or final decision.
If the claim for refund resulted from a notification received from
another state for income taxes due which is more than three
years from the date of filing the Maryland return or more than
two years from the time the tax was paid, a claim for refund
resulting from a credit for taxes paid to that state must be filed
within one year of the date of the notification that the other
state’s tax was due.
If the claim for refund or credit for overpayment resulted from
a final determination made by an administrative board or an ap-
peal of a decision of an administrative board, that is more than
three years from the date of filing the return or more than two
years from the time the tax was paid, the claim for refund must
be filed within one year of the date of the final decision of the ad-
ministrative board or final decision of the highest court to which
an appeal of the administrative board is taken.
No refund for less than $1.00 will be issued. No payment of less
than $1.00 is required.
